==DH 2015 Hackathon==

This repo contains the code produced during the TEI Hackathon in Sydney in 2015.

The task undertaken was to create an automated workflow that would run 
page-images through Tesseract, generate HOCR files, convert those into
TEI, then present a simple rendering of the result side-by-side with 
the page-images.

This code is not curated.
