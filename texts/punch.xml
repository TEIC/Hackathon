        <head>THE ENCHANTED CASTLE.</head>
        <p>There are warm days in <placeName>London</placeName>
when even a window-box fails to charm,
and one longs for the more open spaces
of the country. Besides, one wants to
see how the other flowers are getting
on. It is on these days that we
travel to our Castle of Stopes; as the
crow flies, fifteen miles away. Indeed,
that is the way we get to it, for it is a
castle in the air. And when we are
come to it Celia is always in a pink
sun-bonnet gathering roses lovingly,
and I, not very far off, am speaking
strongly to somebody or other about
something I want done. By-and-by
I shall go into the library and work ...
with an occasional glance through the
open window at Celia.</p>
        <p>To think that a month ago we were
quite happy with a few pink geraniums!</p>
        <p>Sunday, a month ago, was hot.
"Let's take train somewhere," said
Celia, "and have lunch under a hedge."</p>
        <p>"I know a lovely place for hedges,"
I said.</p>
        <p>"I know a lovely tin of potted
grouse," said Celia, and she went off
to cut some sandwiches. By twelve
o'clock we were getting out of the
train.</p>
        <p>The first thing we came to was a golf
course, and Celia had to drag me past
it. Then we came to a wood, and I
had to drag her through it. Another
mile along a lane, and then we both
stopped together.</p>
        <p>"Oh!" we said.</p>
        <p>It was a cottage, the cottage of a
dream. And by a cottage I mean, not
four plain rooms and a kitchen, but one
surprising room opening into another;
rooms all on different levels and of
different shapes, with delightful places
to bump your head on; open fireplaces;
a large square hall, oak-beamed, where
your guests can hang about after breakfast,
while deciding whether to play
golf or sit in the garden. Yet all so
cunningly disposed that from outside
it looks only a cottage or, at most, two
cottages persuaded into one.</p>
        <p>And, of course, we only saw it from
outside. The little drive, determined
to get there as soon as possible, pushed
its way straight through an old barn, and
arrived at the door simultaneously with
the flagged lavender walk for the humble
who came on foot. The rhododendrons
were ablaze beneath the south windows;
a little orchard was running wild on the
west; there was a hint at the back of
a clean-cut lawn. Also, you remember,
there was a golf course, less than two
miles away.</p>
        <p>"Oh," said Celia with a deep sigh,
"but we must live here."</p>
        <p>An Irish terrier ran out to inspect
us. I bent down and patted it. "With
a dog," I added.</p>
        <p>"Isn't it all lovely? I wonder who
it belongs to, and if——"</p>
        <p>"If he'd like to give it to us."</p>
        <p>"Perhaps he would if he saw us and
admired us very much," said Celia
hopefully.</p>
        <p>"I don't think <name>Mr. Barlow</name> is that
sort of man," I said. "An excellent
fellow, but not one to take these sudden
fancies."</p>
        <p>"<name>Mr. Barlow</name>? How do you know
his name?"</p>
        <p>"I have these surprising intuitions,"
I said modestly. "The way the chimneys
stand up——"</p>
        <p>"I know," cried Celia. "The dog's
collar."</p>
        <p>"Right, Watson. And the name of
the house is Stopes."</p>
        <p>She repeated it to herself with a
frown.</p>
        <p>"What a disappointing name," she
said. "Just Stopes."</p>
        <p>"Stopes," I said. "Stopes, Stopes.
If you keep on saying it, a certain old-world
charm seems to gather round it.
Stopes."</p>
        <p>"Stopes," said Celia. "It <hi rend="it">is</hi> rather
jolly."</p>
        <p>We said it ten more times each, and
it seemed the only possible name for it.
Stopes—of course.</p>
        <p>"Well?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"We must write to <name>Mr. Barlow</name>,"
said Celia decisively. "'Dear <name>Mr. Barlow</name>,
er——Dear <name>Mr. Barlow</name>,——we——'
Yes, it will be rather difficult. What
do we want to say exactly?"</p>
        <p>"'Dear <name>Mr. Barlow</name>,—May we have
your house?'"</p>
        <p>"Yes," smiled Celia, "but I'm afraid
we can hardly ask for it. But we
might rent it when—when he doesn't
want it any more."</p>
        <p>"'Dear <name>Mr. Barlow</name>,'" I amended,
"'have you any idea when you're!
going to die?' No, that wouldn't do
either. And there's another thing—we
don't know his initials, or even if he's
a 'Mr.' Perhaps he's a knight or a—a
duke. Think how offended Duke
Barlow would be if we put '—— Barlow,
Esq.' on the envelope."</p>
        <p>"We could telegraph. 'Barlow. After
you with Stopes.'"</p>
        <p>"Perhaps there's a young Barlow,
a Barlowette or two with expectations.
It may have been in the family for
years."</p>
        <p>"Then we——Oh, let's have lunch."
She sat down and began to undo the
sandwiches. "Dear o' Stopes," she
said with her mouth full.</p>
        <p>We lunched outside Stopes. Surely
if Earl Barlow had seen us he would
have asked us in. But no doubt his
dining-room looked the other way;
towards the east and north, as I
pointed out to Celia, thus being pleasantly
cool at lunch-time.</p>
        <p>"Ha, Barlow," I said dramatically,
"a time will come when <hi rend="it">we</hi> shall be
lunching in there, and <hi rend="it">you</hi>——bah!"
And I tossed a potted-grouse sandwich
to his dog.</p>
        <p>However, that didn't get us any
nearer.</p>
        <p>"Will you <hi rend="it">promise</hi>," said Celia,
"that we shall have lunch in there one
day?"</p>
        <p>"I promise," I said readily. That
gave me about sixty years to do something
in.</p>
        <p>"I'm like—who was it who saw
something of another man's and
wouldn't be happy till he got it?"</p>
        <p>"The baby in the soap advertisement."</p>
        <p>"No, no, some king in history."</p>
        <p>"I believe you are thinking of <name>Ahab</name>,
but you aren't a bit like him, really.
Besides, we're not coveting Stopes. All
we want to know is, does Barlow ever
let it in the summer?"</p>
        <p>"That's it," said Celia eagerly.</p>
        <p>"And, if so," I went on, "will he
lend us the money to pay the rent
with?"</p>
        <p>"Er—yes," said Celia. "That's it."</p>
        <milestone rend="hr" unit="rule"/>
        <p>So for a month we have lived in our
Castle of Stopes. I see Celia there in
her pink sun-bonnet, gathering the
flowers lovingly, bringing an armful of
them into the hall, disturbing me sometimes
in the library with "<hi rend="it">Aren't</hi> they
beauties? No, I only just looked in—good
luck to you." And she sees me
ordering a man about importantly,
or waving my hand to her as I ride
through the old barn on my road to
the golf-course.</p>
        <p>But this morning she had an idea.</p>
        <p>"Suppose," she said timidly, "you
<emph rend="it">wrote</emph> about Stopes, and <name>Mr. Barlow</name>;
happened to see it, and knew how much
we wanted it, and——"</p>
        <p>"Well?"</p>
        <p>"Then," said Celia firmly, "if he
were a gentleman he would give it
to us."</p>
        <p>Very well. Now we shall see if Mr.
Barlow is a gentleman.</p>

        <head>EGYPT IN VENICE. "La Légende de Joseph"</head>
        <p>Those who know the kind of attractions
that the Russian ballet offers in so
many of its themes could have easily
guessed, without previous enlightenment,
what episode in the life of <name rend="sc">Joseph</name>
had been selected for illustration last
week at Drury Lane. But they could
never have guessed that Herr <name rend="sc">Tiessen</name>,
author of a shilling guide to the intentions
of the composer, would attach a
transcendental significance to the conduct
of <name>Potiphar's Wife</name>. "Through the
unknown divine," he informs us,
"which is still new and mysterious to
her, an imperious desire awakens in
her to fathom, to possess this world"—the
world, that is to say, which <name>Joseph</name>'s
imagination creates in the course of an
exhibition dance. If this is so, I can
only say that her behaviour is strangely
misleading.</p>
        <p>The scene opens at a party given by
<name>Potiphar</name> in Venice. Venice, of course,
was not <name>Potiphar</name>'s home address; and
I marvel a little at the change of <hi rend="it">venue</hi>
when I think how much more harmony
could have been got out of an Egyptian
setting. But then I remind myself
that the Russian ballet is nothing if not
<hi rend="it">bizarre</hi>. The long banqueting-table
recalls the canvases of <name rend="sc">Veronese</name>, but
with discordant notes of the Orient and
elsewhere. <name>Potiphar</name> himself, seated
on a dais, has the air of an Assyrian
bull. By his side <name>Mme. Potiphar</name> wears
breeches ending above the knee, with
white stockings and high clogs.</p>
        <p>For the entertainment of the guests
there was a dance of nuptial unveiling
and a bout between half-a-dozen Turkish
boxers. But it was a decadent and
<emph>blazé</emph> company, and something more
piquant was needed for their titillation.
This was supplied in the shape
of an original dance by the fifteen-year-old
<name>Joseph</name>, whom my guide describes as
"graceful, wild and pungent." He was
introduced in a recumbent posture, and
asleep, on a covered stretcher, and at
first I had the clever idea that he was
the customary corpse that appeared at
Egyptian feasts to remind the company
of their liability to die. But when he
woke up and began to dance I saw at
once that I was wrong.</p>
        <p>I now know all about the interpretation
of <name>Joseph</name>'s dance; but I defy anyone
to say at sight and without a showman's
assistance what precisely he was
after. In the Third Figure (according
to my guide-book) "there is in his
leaps a feeling of heaviness, as if he
were bound to earth, and he stumbles
once or twice as one who has missed
his goal;" but how was I to guess that
this signified that his "searching after
God" was still ineffectual? or that
when in the Fourth Figure he "leaps
with light feet" this meant that "Joseph
has found God"? I don't blame the boy
for not knowing the rule that forbids
one art to trespass on the domain of
another; but there is no excuse for
Herr <name rend="sc">Strauss</name>, who must have been
well aware that, for the conveyance of
any but the most obvious emotions,
mute dancing can never be a satisfactory
substitute for articulate poetry.</p>
        <p>However, <name>Potiphar</name>'s guests seemed
better instructed than I was, for they
threw off their apathy and took quite an
intelligent interest in <name>Joseph</name>'s 
               <title>pas seul</title>
Indeed, one young man (the episode
escaped me at the dress rehearsal, but I
<pb xml:id="V147_6" n="6"/>
have it in the guide-book)—one young
man, "sobbing, buries his head in his
hands, upsetting thereby a dish of fruit."
As for <name>Potiphar</name>, it failed to stir the
sombre depths of his abysmal boredom,
but his wife, whose ennui had hitherto
been of the most profound, began to sit
up and take notice, and at the end of the
dance she sent for <name>Joseph</name> and supplemented
his rather exiguous costume
with a gross necklace of jewels, letting
her hand linger awhile on his bare neck.
Already, it will be seen, she was intrigued
with the "unknown divine."
<name>Joseph</name>, on the contrary, received
her attentions without
<hi rend="it">empressement</hi>.</p>
        <p>In the next scene—after a
rather woolly and unintelligible
interlude—we see <name>Joseph</name>
retiring to his couch in an
alcove behind the place where
the banqueting-table had
been. You will judge how
urgent was the lady's keenness
to probe the mysteries
of his divine nature
when I tell you that she
could not wait till the morning
to pursue her enquiries,
but must needs visit him in
his chamber at dead of night,
and wearing the one garment
of the hour. At first, still
half dreaming, he mistakes
her for an angel (he had
already seen one in his sleep),
but subsequently, growing
suspicious, he repels her with
a dignified disdain. For I
must tell you that, whatever
the guide-book may allege
about the loftiness of her
designs, the music gave her
away. It reverted, in fact,
to the motive of those passages
which had already accompanied
and illustrated the
nuptial dance, the dance (as
Herr <name rend="sc">Tiessen</name> calls it) of
"burning Love-longing."</p>
        <p>At this juncture, <name>Potiphar</name>
and his minions break upon the scene.
His wife, after denouncing <name>Joseph</name>, is
distracted between passion of hatred
and passion of love, and there is some
play (reminding one of <title>L'Après-midi
d'un Faune</title>) with the purple cloak
which <name>Joseph</name> had discarded. Presently
she eludes her dilemma by fainting.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile it has been the work of
a moment to order up a brazier, a pair
of pincers, a poker, a headsman and
an axe. The instruments of torture
waste no time in getting red-hot; and
we anticipate the worst. <name>Joseph</name>, however,
who has ignored these preparations
and maintained an attitude of
superbly indifferent aloofness, suddenly
becomes luminous under great pressure
of limelight; and most of the cast,
including a ballet of female dervishes,
are abashed to the ground.</p>
        <p>Now appears, on the open-work
entresol at the back of the stage, an
archangel. The guide-book is in error
where it says that he glides downwards
on a shaft of light radiating from a
star. As a matter of fact he walks
down the main staircase to the ground
floor. Approaching <name>Joseph</name> he takes
him by the hand and "leads him
heavenwards" by the same flight of
steps; and we are to understand that,
in the opinion of Herr <name rend="sc">Strauss</name>, the
boy's subsequent career, as recorded
in the Hebraic Scriptures, may be
treated as negligible.</p>
        <p>I should like, in excuse of my own
flippancy, to assume the same detachment,
and to regard this ballet-theme
as having practically no relation whatever
to Biblical history, but being just
one of many themes out of Oriental
lore, mostly secular, that lend themselves

        <head>A SCANDALMONGRIAN ROMANCE. (By Francis Scribble.)</head>
        <p>[<hi rend="it">The following article, specially written
for us by the Author of "Ten Frail
Beauties of the Restoration," "Tales
Told by a Royal Washerwoman,"
etc., is another important contribution
to the literature of the Royal Dirty-Linen
Bag.</hi>]</p>
        <p>A day or two ago a short notice in
the papers told of the death of Mrs.
Maria Tubbs at Cannes; but few, if any,
of those who read that brief announcement
will have recognised in it the
close of one of the most amazing
careers of the nineteenth century. Yet
little surprise need be expressed at this
general ignorance, for who would think
to find under that somewhat common-place
name the ravishingly beautiful
Maria Cotherstone, who, forty years
ago, was swept by Fate into the track
of the late King of Scandalmongria,
and well-nigh caused that singularly
unstable bark to founder? It is with
the kindly object of rescuing her
romance from oblivion that this brief
chronicle is written.</p>
        <p>In 1873 the Scandalmongrian Minister
in <placeName>London</placeName> was requested to find an
English lady to take charge of the two
children of his Royal master, and,
after searching enquiries, he was successful,
and <name>Miss Maria Cotherstone</name>
turned her back on England never more
to return. She was just twenty-two,
fresh and blooming, possessed of the
gayest of spirits, delightful manners
and the highest accomplishments.
Quietly she assumed control of the
Royal schoolroom, and by her charm
no less than by her firmness she
quickly won the respect and love of
her charges. Well had it been for her
memory if her influence had never
spread beyond the walls of her schoolroom;
this article had then been unwritten.
But alas for human nature!
One day His Majesty's eyes fell upon
the person of his children's governess,
and then began one of the most sordid
intrigues it has ever been my pleasure
to recall. [A large statement, as readers
of our author's <title>Gleanings from a Royal
Dustbin</title> will readily acknowledge.
However, the succeeding three-quarter
of a column of details, here omitted,
prove that there is at least some
foundation for the remark.]</p>
        <p>... And so their romance ended,
and His Majesty returned to the bosom
of his family and became once more the
righteous upholder of the sanctity of
the marriage tie. At first his easy-going
Court smiled somewhat at the
claim; but, when one or two highly-placed
officials presumed to follow in
the footsteps of their Sovereign, and
were in consequence banished irrevocably
from his presence, Scandalmongrian
Society realised with a pained
surprise that what is venial in a
monarch may, in a subject, be a
damnable offence.</p>
        <p>And what of Maria, the charming,
fascinating, much injured Maria? For
several years she is lost, and then we
hear of her marriage at Rome to "John
Tubbs, Esq., of <placeName>London</placeName>," and once
again she vanishes, only to turn up
many years later at Cannes. She is a
widow now, and a model of all the
virtues. Who so staid and respectable
as Madam? Who so charitable to the
poor? Few, it is to be feared, will have
recognised in that handsome old lady, so
regular in her attendance at the services
of the English Church, the beauteous
Maria Cotherstone whose name was
once on the lips of everybody from one
end of Europe to the other. It nearly
happened, indeed, that she went down
to her grave with all her scandalous,
feverish past forgotten, leaving behind
her only the fragrant memory of her
later life. But I have saved her. It is
a queer story, quite interesting enough
to recall.</p>

        <p>My dinner partner was a self-made
man and not ashamed of it.</p>
        <p>"Do you take an interest in china,
ma'am?" he asked me.</p>
        <p>I felt that if I said "Yes" I should
have to buy some. So I said "No,"
but he didn't wait to hear what I said.</p>
        <p>"I think I may say," he continued,
"that I have the finest collection of
old Dresden china in <placeName>London</placeName>."</p>
        <p>He went into the figures, explaining
the cost price and the difficulty of
storage.</p>
        <p>"Oh," said I, "if you find it a
nuisance, I've a parlour-maid I could
recommend to you; just the girl to
help you to get rid of it."</p>
        <p>At this point I think he had some
idea of having the finest collection of
parlourmaids in Middlesex, but he made
it small dogs instead. Was I interested
in these? No, but I supposed I'd have
to be if he insisted.</p>
        <p>"I don't think I should be far
wrong," he began, but I hustled him
through to the end of his sentence.</p>
        <p>"Finest collection in—?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"England," he said.</p>
        <p>He went over their points, and in an
expansive moment I marvelled. This
was imprudent, as it caused him to
search his mind for some further spectacular
triumph wherewith to amaze
and delight.</p>
        <p>"That," he said, looking up the table,
"is my wife."</p>
        <p>"Marvellous," said I.</p>
        <p>He took this in the best part. "You
refer to her diamonds?" he said.</p>
        <p>"Did I?" said I.</p>
        <p>"The finest collection in Great
Britain," he declared, and spread himself
over the subject.</p>
        <p>Later, in a mood of concession, he
inquired as to my specialities. I had
none, at least none that I could think
of. Determined to extract something
noteworthy, he questioned me on every
possibility. Was I not married? That
was so, I agreed, but then so many
women are.</p>
        <p>"You have sons, ma'am?" he persisted,
with that implacable optimism to
which, among other things, he no doubt
owed his success in the world.</p>

        <head rend="sc">(Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.)</head>
        <p><hi rend="it">House of Commons, Monday, June 22.</hi>—Great
muster of forces on both sides.
Not wholly explained by second reading
of Budget Bill standing as first
Order. A section of Ministerialists,
purists in finance, took exception to
proposed procedure. <name rend="sc">Holt</name>, spokesman
at mouth of new Cave, put down
amendment challenging <name rend="sc">Chancellor
of Exchequer</name>'s proposals. Here was
chance for watchful Opposition. If
some thirty Ministerialists would go
with them into Lobby it would not
quite suffice to turn out Ministry; but it
would be better than a Snap Division,
with its personal inconvenience of
preliminary hiding in bath-rooms and
underground cellars.</p>

rule!"</p><p>["I did not expect ... that hon. members would go rummaging in the
dustbins of ancient precedent to find obstacles to place in the way
of these proposals." — <hi rend="it">Mr. LLOYD GEORGE on his Budget</hi>.]</p></figure><name rend="sc">Cassel</name>, adding to Parliamentary
reputation studiously attained, raised
subject on point of order. Underlying
suggestion was that Budget Bill should
be withdrawn and reintroduced under
amended form of procedure. <hi rend="sc">Speaker</hi>,
whilst admitting irregularity, stopped
short of approving extreme course.
Pointed out that the matter might be
put right by moving fresh resolutions.</p>
        <p>This disappointing. Worse to follow.
The <name rend="sc">Infant Samuel</name>, making fresh
appearance in new part of understudy
of <name rend="sc">Chancellor of Exchequer</name>, conceded
point of procedure made by
Radical Cave. Promised objection should
be fully met. <name rend="sc">Holt</name>, amid ironical
cheers from Opposition, said in these
circumstances would not move amendment.
Incident reminded <name rend="sc">Walter
Long</name> of story of the Colonel and the
opossum up a tree.</p>
        <p>"Don't shoot!" said the Opossum;
"I'll come down."</p>
        <p><name rend="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</name> had
come down. No need for Colonel <name rend="sc">Holt</name>
to discharge his gun.</p>
        <p>Thus threatened crisis blew over.
Members, cheered by promise of reduction
by one half of proposed increase
in Income Tax, got away early to
attend various functions in honour of
<hi rend="sc">King</hi>'s birthday.</p>
        <p><hi rend="it">Business done.</hi>—Second reading of
Budget Bill moved.</p>
        <p><hi rend="it">House of Lords, Tuesday.</hi>—<placeName>London</placeName>
season in full fling. May be said to
reach dizziest height in this birthday
week. Social engagements numerous
and clashing. To-day House of Lords
magnet of attraction of surpassing
force. The thing for <foreign xml:lang="fr">grandes dames</foreign>
to do is to go down to the House
and be present at opening of fresh
tourney round Home Rule Bill.
Accordingly, the peeresses, alive to
their responsibility as leaders of high
thinking and simple living, flock down
to Westminster, filling side-galleries
with grace, beauty, and some finely
feathered hats.</p>
        <p>Seats on floor also crowded. Patriotic
peers arriving late, finding no room on
the benches where the Union Jack is
kept flying, cross over. Temporarily
seat themselves among the comparatively
scanty flock of discredited
Ministerialists. Bishops muster in
exceptional number. Their rochets
form wedge of spotless white thrust
in centre of black-coated laity seated
below Gangway on right of Woolsack.
Space before Throne thronged with
Privy Councillors availing themselves
of the privilege their rank confers to
come thus closely into contact with
what is still an hereditary chamber.</p>

          <p>"Bill presented to Lords as a sort of lay-figure which

        </figure>
        <p>In centre of first row <name rend="sc">Carson</name> uplifts
his tall figure and surveys a scene he
has done much to make possible.</p>
        <p>Perhaps in matter of dramatic interest
the play did not quite come up to its
superb setting. Principal parts taken
by <name rend="sc">Crewe</name> and <name rend="sc">Lansdowne</name>. Neither
accustomed to move House to spasms
of enthusiasm. <name rend="sc">Leader of House</name>,
introducing what is officially known as
Government of Ireland Amending Bill,
made it clear in such sentences as were
fully audible that scheme does not go
a step beyond overture towards settlement
proffered by <name rend="sc">Premier</name> last March.</p>
        <p><name rend="sc">Lansdowne</name> expressed profound disappointment
at this lack of enterprise.
"Rather a shabby and undignified
proceeding on the part of a strong
Government," he said, "to come down
with proposal they know to be wholly
inadequate, and to hint that we ought
to assist them in converting it into a
practical and workable measure."</p>
        <p>Actual condition of things could not
with equal brevity be more clearly
stated. Bill presented to Lords as
sort of lay figure, which they may, in
accordance with taste and conviction,
suitably clothe. No assurance forthcoming
that style and fit will be
approved when submitted to House of
Commons, final arbiters.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile Bill read a first time, and
ordered to be printed.</p>
        <pb xml:id="V147_14" n="14"/>
        <p><hi rend="it">Business done.</hi>—The Commons still
harping on the Budget. <name rend="sc">Tim Healy</name>
enlivened proceedings by vigorous personal
attack on "the most reckless and
incapable <name rend="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</name>
that ever sat on the Treasury
Bench." <name rend="sc">Lloyd George</name>'s retort courteous
looked forward to with interest.</p>
        <p><hi rend="it">House of Commons, Wednesday.</hi>—When,
shortly after half-past five, <name rend="sc">Chancellor
Of Exchequer</name> rose to take
part in debate on new development of
Budget Bill, House nearly empty. Interests
at stake enormous. Situation
enlivened for Opposition by quandary
of Government. But afternoon is hot,
and from the silver Thames cool air
blows over Terrace. Accordingly thither
Members repair, leaving House to
solitude and <name rend="sc">Chiozza Money</name>.</p>
        <p>Benches rapidly filled when news went round that <hi rend="sc">Chancellor</hi> was on his legs. Soon there was
         crowded audience. Sound of cheering and counter-cheering,
         applausive and derisive, frequently broke forth. <hi rend="sc">Chancellor</hi> in fine fighting
         form. Malcontents in his own camp are reconciled. Hereditary
         foe in front. Went for him accordingly.  <name rend="sc">Walter Long</name> seated immediately opposite
         conveniently served as suitable target for whirling
         lance. Effectively quoted from speeches made by him at other
         times, insisting upon relief of the rate so heavily burdoned
         as to make it impossible to carry out social reforms of
         imperative necessity.</p>
        <p>"After these lavish professions of
anxiety to help local authorities, I did
not," said the <hi rend="sc">Chancellor</hi>, "expect
the right hon. gentleman and his friends
would go rummaging in the dustbins of
ancient precedent, to find obstacles to
place in the way of proposals of
reform."</p>
        <p>Carried away by his own eloquence,
the <hi rend="sc">Chancellor</hi>, whilst sarcastically
complimentary to <name rend="sc">Walter Long</name>, went
so far as to call him "The Father of
Form IV." The putative parent
blushed. There were cries of "Order!"
and "Withdraw!" <hi rend="sc">Speaker</hi> did not
interpose, and <hi rend="sc">Chancellor</hi> hurried on
to another point of his argument.</p>
        <p>Quite a long time since our old
friend Form IV., at one time a familiar
impulse to party vituperation, was
mentioned in debate. This unexpected
disclosure of its paternity made quite
a stir.</p>
        <p><name rend="sc">Son Austen</name> followed <hi rend="sc">Chancellor</hi>
in brisk speech that led to one or two
interludes of angry interruption across
the Table. When he made an end of
speaking, debate relapsed into former
condition of languor. Talk dully kept
up till half-past eleven.</p>
        <p><hi rend="it">Business done.</hi>—Further debate on
Budget.</p>
        <p><hi rend="it">Thursday.</hi>—<name rend="sc">Chancellor of Exchequer</name>
admittedly allured by what
he describes as "attractive features" of
proposal to raise fresh revenue. It is
simply the levying of a special tax on
all persons using titles.</p>
        <p>Idea not absolutely new. Principle
established in case of citizens displaying
crest or coat-of-arms. What is novel is
suggested method of taxation. Differing
from the dog-tax, levied at a common
rate, it is proposed that our old nobility
shall, in this fresh recognition of
their lofty estate, be dealt with on a
sliding scale. A duke will have his
pre-eminence recognised by an exceptionally
high rate of taxation. Marquises,
earls and a' that will be mulct
on a descending scale, till the lowly
knight is reached. He will be compensated
for comparative obscurity in the
glittering throng by being let off for a
nominal sum.</p>
        <p><hi rend="sc">Chancellor</hi> fears it is too late to
adopt proposal this year, a way of
putting it which seems to suggest that
we may hear more of it in next
year's Budget.</p>
        <p><hi rend="it">Business done.</hi>—<name rend="sc">Hayes Fisher</name>'s
Amendment to Budget Bill negatived
by 303 votes to 265. Reduction of
Ministerial majority to 38 hailed with
boisterous burst of cheers and counter-cheers.</p>

        <p>No, this is not the Russian ballet.
It is the English Folk Dance Society,
and their performances at the Royal
Horticultural Hall at Westminster the
other day showed that the Russian
ballet is not to have things all its own
way. I am not going to moralise upon
the salacious quality of some of the
themes of our exotic visitors, but
certainly it would be difficult to find a
stronger contrast to their ruling passion
than is presented by the purity and
simplicity of these country dances.</p>
        <p>"Sellinger's Bound," danced to an
air that lulled <title>Titania</title> to sleep all
through the winter at the Savoy, was
the most popular, with its ring of a
dozen dancers, hands joined, running
together into the centre of their circle,
as if to honour some imaginary deity—possibly
<persName>Mr. <name rend="sc">Cecil
Sharp</name>
               </persName>, director of the
Society, who has collected
and revived the
airs to which they dance.</p>
        <p>Then there were the Morris-dances, "Shepherd's Hey" (with nothing
about a "nonny-nonny" in it), and "Haste to the Wedding."  There might
perhaps be a greater propriety in the latter if it were confined to
men; but at least it raised no apprehension that anybody was going to
"repent at leisure."  In the "Flamborough Sword" dance, the men (with
no Amazon assistance) raced through the figure and out again, eight of
them, armed with bloodless wooden swords—a finely ordered riot.</p>
        <p>"Lady's Pleasure," a Morris-jig for two men, lays hold of you at
the first bar, and again with a fresh grip and a tighter as the music
slows up for the dancers to do their "capers"—all to the music of
<persName>Mr. <name rend="sc">Cecil Sharp</name>
               </persName> at the
piano and <persName>Miss <name rend="sc">Avril</name>
               </persName> at
the fiddle.</p>
        <p>The object of The English Folk
Dance Society is to teach rather than
to perform in public. Hence the rarity
of their displays, and the better reason
why we should seize, when they come,
our chances of assisting at these
delightful exhibitions of an art whose
revival has done so much to restore to
the countryside the unpretentious joys
that gave its name to Merrie England.</p>

["If one man has more brains than another,
which enable him to outstrip his fellows, is
not that good fortune? What had he got to
do with it? If your brain is a bad one, it is
not your responsibility. If your brain is a
good one it is not your merit. Some men
have greater physical, mental, moral strength
than others that enables them to win in the
race. That is their good fortune and they
ought to be grateful for it; and the one way
they can best show their gratitude is by
helping those who are less fortunate than
themselves. Men endowed with any, or most,
or all of these fortunate conditions ought not
to be stingy in helping others who have not
been so fortunate as themselves."—<persName>Mr.

since I was called to the Bar, and
several of my contemporaries have
already been elevated to the Bench,
while Sir <name rend="sc">John Simon</name>, who is considerably
my junior, is in the receipt of a
salary probably double that drawn by

from income-tax, but this is but a poor
consolation when I consider that were
it not for the caprice of fortune I should
probably be returning £400 or £500 a
year to the Exchequer in super-tax.
But not only have I been badly treated
in regard to mental equipment; I have
been further handicapped by hereditary
conscientious objection to pay any bills.
An annuity of £500 a year, or only one-tenth

that the extra drain on my resources

        <head>THE CURE FOR CRICKET.</head>
        <p>There is no longer any doubt that
golf is threatening the supremacy of
our national game. Judged by the
only true standard—the amount of
space allotted to it in the daily press—it
is manifest that the encroachments of
this insidious pastime have now reached
a point where the cricket reformer must
bestir himself before it is too late. We
are convinced that so far we have been
taking much too narrow a view. The
time has come to look for light and
leading outside the confines of our own
Book of Rules. There are other games
besides cricket. Let us call them to
our councils.</p>
        <p>In the first place a valuable hint
may surely be found in the development
of Rugby football. It is common
knowledge what immense results have
followed the introduction, some twenty
years ago, of the Four Three-quarter
System. No spectator (and we cannot
exist without the spectator) would ever
dream now of returning to the old
formation. Very well. The same
principle can be easily adapted to our
requirements in the form of the Three
Batsmen System. The pitch would
become an equilateral triangle, and we
should suggest that the bowler have
the option of bowling (from his own
corner) at either of the two outlying
batsmen (at theirs). Lots of interesting
developments would follow, as, for
instance, the institution of a sort of
silly-point-short-mid-on in the centre
of the triangle. (Should he be allowed
to wear gloves?)</p>
        <p>Golf has also a lesson to teach us.
We are all familiar with the huge
strides that have been made by the introduction
of the rubber-cored ball.
We don't want to plagiarize, although
a rubber-cored cricket ball is a nice
idea. Why not aim at the opposite
extreme and try a ball "reinforced"
with concrete? The tingling of the
batsman's fingers which might result
could be neutralised by the use of a
rubber-faced bat. This reform would,
we believe, have one happy consequence.
People wouldn't be so keen
to play with their legs.</p>
        <p>As to lawn tennis—another dangerous
rival—we hear a good deal in these
days about "foot-faults." That seems
to show the trend of modern thought.
If we are to be in the swim we shall
have to reconsider our no-ball rule.
Why not make it a no-ball every time
unless the bowler has both feet in the
air at the moment when the ball leaves
his hand? One might put up a little
hurdle—nothing obtrusive—only a
matter of a few inches high.</p>
        <p>We believe that something might
even be done by borrowing from hockey
the principle of the semi-circle, outside
of which a goal may not be shot. The
whole pitch might be enclosed in a
circular crease—which would look uncommonly
well in Press photographs.
(We cannot exist without the Press.)
No fielder inside the magic circle would
be allowed to stop the ball with his
feet.</p>
        <p>Finally there is the case of billiards,
not a game that is very closely allied
to cricket, but one from which much
may be learned. How has billiards
brightened itself? By adopting the
great principle of "barring" certain
strokes. Here we have got on to something
really valuable. We propose to
go one better, and draw up a schedule
of the different conditions of barring
under which matches may be played.
It will only remain for secretaries, when
fixtures are made, to arrange the terms
by negotiation. In time to come,
should we be able to carry our point, we
shall all be familiar with such announcements
as the following:—</p>
        <quote>
          <p>
Notts. <hi>v.</hi> Surrey. (Cut-barred.)
Gentlemen <hi>v.</hi> Players. (L.b.w.-barred.)
England <hi>v.</hi> Australia. (Googly-and-yorker-barred.)
</p>
        </quote>
        <p>We do not pretend to have exhausted
the subject, but we have made a start.
We must look about us. Something
may be learned, we firmly believe, even
from skittles and ping-pong. Our
national game cannot afford to exclude
special features. It should have the
best of everything.</p>

        <p>Once upon a time a poet was sitting
at his desk in his cottage near the
woods, trying to write.</p>
        <p>It was a hot summer day and great
fat white clouds were sailing across the
sky. He knew that he ought to be
out, but still he sat on, pen in hand,
trying to write.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, among all the other sounds
of busy urgent life that were filling the
warm sweet air, he heard the new and
unaccustomed song of a bird. At least
not new and not unaccustomed, but new
and unaccustomed there, in this sylvan
retreat. The notes poured out, now
shrill, now mellow, now bubbling like
musical water, but always rich with
the joy of life, the fulness of happiness.
Where had he heard it before? What
bird could it be?</p>
        <p>Suddenly the poet's housekeeper hurried
in. "Oh, Sir," she exclaimed,
"isn't it a pity? Someone's canary
has got free, and it's singing out here
something beautiful."</p>
        <p>"Of course," said the poet—"a
canary;" and he hastened out to see
it. But before he could get there the
bird had flown to a clump of elms a
little way off, from which proceeded
sweeter and more tumultuously exultant
song than they had ever known.</p>
        <p>The poet walked to the elms with his
field-glasses, and after a while he discerned
among the million leaves, the
little yellow bird, with its throat trembling
with rapture.</p>
        <p>But the poet and his housekeeper
were not the only creatures who had
heard the strange melody.</p>
        <p>"I say," said one sparrow to another,
"did you hear that?"</p>
        <p>"What?" inquired the other sparrow,
who was busy collecting food for a very
greedy family.</p>
        <p>"Why, listen," said the first sparrow.</p>
        <p>"Bless my soul," said the second.
"I never heard that before."</p>
        <p>"That's a strange bird," said the
first sparrow; "I've seen it. It's all
yellow."</p>
        <p>"All yellow?" said the other. "What
awful cheek!"</p>
        <p>"Yes, isn't it?" replied the first
sparrow. "Can you understand what
it says?"</p>
        <p>"Not a note," said the second.
"Another of those foreigners, I suppose.
We shan't have a tree to call our
own soon."</p>
        <p>"That's so," said the first. "There's
no end to them. Nightingales are bad
enough, grumbling all night, and swallows,
although there's not so many of
them this year as usual; but when it
comes to yellow birds—well."</p>
        <p>"Hullo," said a passing tit, "what's
the trouble now?"</p>
        <p>"Listen," said the sparrows.</p>
        <p>The tit was all attention for a minute
while the gay triumphant song went on.</p>
        <p>"Well," he said, "that's a rum go.
That's new, that is. Novel, I call it.
What is it?"</p>
        <p>"It's a yellow foreigner," said the
sparrows.</p>
        <p>"What's to be done with it?" the
tit asked.</p>
        <p>"There's only one thing for self-respecting
British birds to do," said
the first sparrow. "Stop it. Teach
it a lesson."</p>
        <p>"Absolutely," said the tit. "I'll go
and find some others."</p>
        <p>"Yes, so will we," said the sparrows;
and off they all flew, full of righteous
purpose.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile the canary sang on and
on, and the poet at the foot of the tree
listened with delight.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, however, he was conscious
of a new sound—a noisy chirping and
harsh squeaking which seemed to fill
the air, and a great cloud of small angry
birds assailed the tree. For a while
the uproar was immense, and the song
ceased; and then, out of the heart of
the tumult, pursued almost to the
ground where the poet stood, fell the
body of a little yellow bird, pecked to
death by a thousand avenging furies.</p>
        <p>Seeing the poet they made off in a
pack, still shrilling and squawking, but
conscious of the highest rectitude.</p>
        <p>The poet picked up the poor mutilated
body. It was still warm and it
twitched a little, but never could its
life and music return.</p>
        <p>While he stood thoughtfully there an
old woman, holding an open cage and
followed by half-a-dozen children, hobbled
along the path.</p>
        <p>"My canary got away," she said.
"Have you seen it? It flew in this
direction."</p>
        <p>"I'm afraid I have seen it," said the
poet, and he opened his hand.</p>
        <p>"My little pet!" said the old woman.
"It sang so beautifully, and it used to
feed from my fingers. My little pet."</p>
        <p>The poet returned to his work. "'In
tooth and claw,'" he muttered to himself,
"'In tooth and claw.'"</p>

        <head>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</head>
        <head rend="it">(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerics.)</head>
        <p><title>Tents of a Night</title> (<name rend="sc">Smith, Elder</name>) is a quite ordinary story,
about entirely commonplace persons, which has however
an original twist in it. I never met a story that conveyed
so vividly the nastiness of a summer holiday that isn't nice.
The holiday was in Brittany, just the common round,
Cherbourg, Coutances, Mont St. Michel, and the rest of it;
and the holiday-makers were <name>Mr. and Mrs. Hepburn</name>, their
niece <name>Anne</name>, and a rather pleasant flapper named <name>Barbara</name>
whom they had taken in charge. <name>Anne</name> is the heroine and
central character of the holiday; and certainly whatever
discomforts it contained she seems to have done her successful
best to add to. "This is a beastly place!" was her
written comment upon St. Michel; and it was typical of her
attitude throughout. Of course the real trouble with <title>Anne</title>
was something deeper than drains or crowded hotels or the
smell of too many omelettes: she was in love. Apparently
she was more or less in love with two men, <name>Dragotin Voinovich</name>
(whose name was a constant worry to <name>Anne</name>'s aunt,
and I am bound to say that I share her feelings about it)
and <name>Jimmy Fordyce</name>, a pleasant young Englishman who
pulls the girls out of quicksands and makes himself
generally agreeable. In the end, however—but on second
thoughts the end, emotionally speaking, of <title>Anne</title> is just
what I shall not tell you, as it is precisely the thing that
redeems the book from being commonplace. This you will
enjoy; and also those remarkably real descriptions of
various plage-hotels in August, the noise, the crowds, the
long hot meals, the sunshine and constant wind, the sand
on the staircase, and the general atmosphere of wet bathing-gowns—all
these are a luxurious delight to read about
in a comfortable English room. <persName>Miss <name rend="sc">Mary Findlater</name>
               </persName>
evidently knows them.</p>
        <milestone rend="hr" unit="rule"/>
        <p>Dippers who have given a new meaning to the classical
motto, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Respice finem</foreign>, are so common amongst novel readers
that <name rend="sc">Patricia Wentworth</name> will only have herself to thank
if many who are unfamiliar with her work fail to do justice
to a book nine-tenths of which is thoroughly interesting
and excellently well-written. As a boy, the hero of <title>Simon
Heriot</title> (<name rend="sc">Melrose</name>) is misunderstood, and although <name>Mr.
Martin</name>, his step-father, is a somewhat stagey specimen of
the heavy and vulgar papa, the child's emotions (as, for
instance, when he pretends that the storm of his parent's
wrath is the ordeal of the Inquisition or some far-away
battle of paladins in which he is contending) are finely
conceived, and many of the later passages in <name>Simon</name>'s life—his
unhappy love affair with <name>Maud Courtney</name>, his relations
with his grandmother and with <name>William Forster</name>, the schoolmaster—are
quite engrossing and give occasion for memorable
sketches of character. It is when the natural end of
the story is reached, and <name>Simon</name> has come into his own and
has just been wedded to his proper affinity, that the structure
seems to me to fall with a crash. I might perhaps,
though not without reluctance, have pardoned an impertinent
railway accident which leaves the young man apparently
<pb xml:id="V147_20" n="20"/>
crippled for life, but the last chapters, in which he finds
spiritual comfort and (after the doctors have given up hope)
complete anatomical readjustment through the ministrations
of faith healing, alienated me entirely. From the
outset the obvious scheme of the novel is to bring the hero
back happily to the home and, if you will, the rustic church
of his ancestors; and, though the science of Christian
healing may do all that its adherents claim for it, it has
about as much to do with the case of <name>Simon Heriot</name> as the
dancing dervishes or the rites of Voodoo.</p>
        <p><name rend="sc">Demetra Vaka</name> has melted my literary
            heart. By way of homage to her I eat the dust and recant
            all the hard and bitter things I said and thought in my
            youth concerning Ancient Greece; especially I apologise,
            on behalf of myself and my pedagogues, for after regarding
            its language as a dead one. <title>A Child of the
            Orient</title> (<name rend="sc">Lane</name>) has taught me
            better, though the last object the author appears to have
            in view is to educate. This "Greek girl brought up in a
            Turkish household" writes to amuse, entertain and charm,
            and her success is abundant.  Whether it is attributable
            to the romantic particulars of the Turkish household or to
            the ingenuous personality of the Greek girl, I hesitate to
            say, since both are so captivating; but this I know, that,
            considered as descriptive sketches or personal episodes,
            each of the twenty-two chapters is a separate delight.
            For the ready writer material is not wanting in the Near
            East; a fine theme is provided in the national ambition of
            the Greek, who cannot forget his glorious past and be
            content with his less conspicuous present. As for the love
            interest, who should supply this better than the Turk? In
            these days of cosmopolitanism there are bound to be
            romantic complications in the lives of a polygamous people
            situate in a monogamous continent.  By way of postscript
            the authoress travels abroad and deals with alien matters;
            her impression, I gather, is that if her ancestors of
            classical times could see our world of to-day and express
            an opinion upon it the best of their praise would be
            reserved for the fact of the British Empire, and the worst
            of their abuse be spent upon what is known as American
            humour. I am so constituted that I cannot but be
            prejudiced in favour of a writer gifted with so profound a
            judgment.</p>

        <p>The creatrix of <name>Pam</name> must look to her
         laurels. Slovenliness is the aptest word to apply to the
         workmanship of <title>Maria</title> (<name rend="sc">Hutchinson</name>), the latest heroine of the
         <persName>Baroness <name rend="sc">Von
         Hutten</name>
               </persName>. <title>Maria</title> has the air of
         having been contracted for, while that fastidious overseer
         who lurks at the elbow of every honest craftsman, condemning
         this or that phrase, readjusting the other faulty piece of
         construction, has frankly abandoned the
         contractor. <name>Maria</name> was the daughter of an artist
         cadger (name of <name>Drello</name>), friend of the great and
         seller of their autograph letters, whereby he was astute
         enough to make a comfortable living. <name>Maria</name> had a
         dull brother named <name>Laertes</name>, who accidentally met
         a highness, who fell very abruptly in love with
         <name>Maria</name> and made her strictly dishonourable
         proposals. <name>Maria</name> drew herself up, compelled him
         to apologise and go away, until the nineteenth chapter, when
         she made similar proposals to the highness, now a duly and
         unhappily married <name>King of Sarmania</name>. But she is
         saved by the chivalrous love-lorn dwarf, <name>Tomsk</name>,
         who, with the irascible singing-master <name>Sulzer</name>,
         is responsible for the chief elements of vitality in this
         rather suburban romance. And I found myself never believing
         in <name>Maria</name>'s wondrous beauty and quite sharing
         <name>Sulzer</name>'s poor opinion of her singing. But this
         of course was mere prejudice.</p>

        <p>In <title>Grizel Married</title> (<name rend="sc">Mills

         Vaizey</name> exhibits the highest-handed method of treating
         Romance that ever I met. For consider the situation to be
         resolved. <name>Dane Peignton</name> was engaged to
         <name>Teresa</name>, but in love with <name>Lady Cassandra
         Raynor</name>, whose husband, I regret to add, was still
         alive. <name>Dane</name> and <name>Cassandra</name> had never
         told their love, and concealment might have continued to prey
         on their damask cheeks, if <persName>Mrs.  <name rend="sc">Vaizey</name>
               </persName> had not (very naturally),
         wished to give us a big emotional scene of avowal. It is the
         way in which this is done that compels my homage. Off go the
         characters on a picnic, obviously big with
         fate. <name>Teresa</name> goes, and <name>Dane</name> and
         <name>Cassandra</name>, the fourth being <name>Grizel</name>,
         whom you may recall pleasantly from an earlier book; but,
         though she fills the title <hi rend="it">rôle</hi> in this
         one, she has little to do with its development. Of course I
         saw that something tragic was going to happen to somebody on
         that picnic—cliffs or tides or mad bulls or something. But I
         don't suppose that in twenty guesses you could get at the
         actual instrument of destiny.  <name>Cassandra</name> chokes
         over a fish-bone! That's what I meant about Mrs. <name rend="sc">Vaizey</name>'s courage. And the reward of it is
         that, after your first moment of incredulity, the fish-bone
         isn't in the least bit absurd. Poor <name>Cassandra</name>
         comes quite near to expiring of it; and <name>Dane</name>,
         having thumped and battered her into safety, sobs out his
         wild and whirling passion, while <name>Grizel</name> and poor
         <name>Teresa</name> have just to sit about and listen. It
         really is rather a striking and original climax; incidentally
         it is far the best scene in an otherwise not very brilliant
         tale. But, having attended that picnic, I shall be astonished
         if you don't, want to go on to the end and see how it all
         straightens out.</p>

        <head>A WARM HALF-HOUR.</head>
        <p>Whatever the papers say, it was the hottest afternoon of the
year. At six-thirty I had just finished dressing after my third
cold bath since lunch, when Celia tapped on the door.</p>
        <p>"I want you to do something for me," she said. "It's a shame to
ask you on a day like this."</p>
        <p>"It <hi rend="it">is</hi> rather a shame," I agreed, "but I can always
refuse."</p>
        <p>"Oh, but you mustn't. We haven't got any ice, and the Thompsons
are coming to dinner. Do you think you could go and buy three
pennyworth? Jane's busy, and I'm busy, and——"</p>
        <p>"And I'm busy," I said, opening and shutting a drawer with great
rapidity.</p>
        <p>"Just three pennyworth," she pleaded. "Nice cool ice. Think of
sliding home on it."</p>
        <p>Well, of course it had to be done. I took my hat and staggered
out. On an ordinary cool day it is about half-a-mile to the
fishmonger; to-day it was about two miles-and-a-quarter. I arrived
exhausted, and with only just strength enough to kneel down and
press my forehead against the large block of ice in the middle of
the shop, round which the lobsters nestled.</p>
        <p>"Here, you mustn't do that," said the fishmonger, waving me
away.</p>
        <p>I got up, slightly refreshed.</p>
        <p>"I want," I said, "some——" and then a thought
occurred to me.</p>
        <p>After all, <hi rend="it">did</hi> fishmongers sell ice? Probably the large
block in front of me was just a trade sign like the coloured
bottles at the chemist's. Suppose I said to a Fellow of the
Pharmaceutical Society, "I want some of that green stuff in the
window," he would only laugh. The tactful thing to do would be to
buy a pint or two of laudanum first, and <hi rend="it">then</hi>, having
established pleasant relations, ask him as a friend to lend me his
green bottle for a bit.</p>
        <p>So I said to the fishmonger, "I want some—some nice
lobsters."</p>
        <p>"How many would you like?"</p>
        <p>"One," I said.</p>
        <p>We selected a nice one between us, and he wrapped a piece of
<title>Daily Mail</title> round it, leaving only the whiskers visible, and
gave it to me. The ice being now broken—I mean the ice being
now—well, you see what I mean—I was now in a position
to ask for some of his ice.</p>
        <p>"I wonder if you could let me have a little piece of your ice,"
I ventured.</p>
        <p>"How much ice do you want?" he said promptly.</p>
        <p>"Sixpennyworth," I said, not knowing a bit how much it would be,
but feeling that Celia's threepennyworth sounded rather mean.</p>
        <p>"Six of ice, Bill," he shouted to an inferior at the back, and
Bill tottered up with a block about the size of one of the lions in
Trafalgar Square. He wrapped a piece of <title>Daily News</title> round it
and gave it to me.</p>
        <p>"Is that all?" asked the fishmonger.</p>
        <p>"That is all," I said faintly; and, with Algernon, the
overwhiskered crustacean, firmly clutched in the right hand and
Stonehenge supported on the palm of the left hand, I retired.</p>
        <p>The flat seemed a very long way away, but having bought twice as
much ice as I wanted, and an entirely unnecessary lobster, I was
not going to waste still more money in taxis. Hot though it was, I
would walk.</p>
        <p>For some miles all went well. Then the ice began to drip through
the paper, and in a little while the underneath part of <title>The
Daily News</title> had disappeared altogether. Tucking the lobster
under my arm I turned the block over, so that it rested on another
part of the paper. Soon that had dissolved too. By the time I had
got half-way our Radical contemporary had been entirely eaten.</p>
        <p>Fortunately <title>The Daily Mail</title> remained. But to get it I had
to disentangle Algernon first, and I had no hand available. There
was only one thing to do. I put the block of ice down on the
pavement, unwrapped the lobster, put the lobster temporarily in my
pocket, spread its <title>Daily Mail</title> out next to the ice, lifted
the ice on to the paper, and—looked up and saw Mrs. Thompson
approaching.</p>
        <p>She was the last person I wanted at that moment. In an hour and
a half she would be dining with us. Algernon would not be dining
with us. If Algernon and Mrs. Thompson were to meet now, would she
not be expecting him to turn up at every course? Think of the
long-drawn-out disappointment for her; not even lobster sauce!</p>
        <p>There was no time to lose. I decided to abandon the ice. Leaving
it on the pavement I turned round and walked hastily back the way I
had come.</p>
        <p>By the time I had shaken off Mrs. Thompson I was almost at the
fishmonger's. That decided me. I would begin all over again, and
would do it properly this time.</p>
        <p>"I want," I said boldly, "threepennyworth of ice."</p>
        <p>"Three of ice, Bill," said the fishmonger, and Bill gave me
quite a respectable segment in <title>The Morning Post</title>.</p>
        <p>"And I want a taxi," I said, and I summoned one.</p>
        <p>We drove quickly home.</p>
        <p>As we neared the flat I suddenly remembered Algernon. I drew him
out of my pocket, red and undraped.</p>
        <p>This would never do. If the porter saw me entering my residence
with a nice lobster, the news would soon get about, and before I
knew where I was I should have a super-tax form sprung on me. I
placed the block of ice on the seat, took off its <title>Morning
Post</title>, and wrapped up Algernon. Then I sprang out, gave the man
a shilling, and got into the lift.</p>
        <milestone rend="stars" unit="rule"/>
        <p>"Bless you," said Celia, "have you got it? How sweet of you!"
And she took my parcel from me. "Now we shall be
able——Why, what's this?"</p>
        <p>I looked at it closely.</p>
        <p>"It's—it's a lobster," I said, "Didn't you say
lobster?"</p>
        <p>"I said ice."</p>
        <p>"Oh," I said, "oh, I didn't understand. I thought you said
lobster."</p>
        <p>"You can't put lobster in cider cup," said Celia severely.</p>
        <p>Of course I quite see that. It was rather a silly mistake of
mine. However, it's pleasant to think that the taxi must have been
nice and cool for the next man.</p>

        <head>PAYMENT IN KIND.</head>
        <p>I argued that one and threepence was too much to pay for the
delivery of a telegram which had only cost sixpence itself; I also
argued that one and threepence was too little for a wealthy
institution like the G.P.O. to worry about, but the messenger
wouldn't reduce the price. I had had my telegram, said he, and I
must pay for it. I offered to give him the telegram back, but he
guessed it was only from Carr and wasn't having any. It was my
money he wanted and that, unhappily, was some miles away in a
bank.</p>
        <p>For reasons best known to myself, and not too clearly
appreciated even in that quarter, I am always full of petty cash at
the beginning of the month and out of it at the end. My wife never
draws any at all, knowing it is much safer where it is, and as for
Albert, our only son, he takes no interest in the stuff. When we,
in moments of self-denial, slip a coin into the slit of his
money-box, he is merely bored, being as yet unable to unlock the
box and get the coin out again, owing to ignorance of the
whereabouts of the key. I explained all this to the telegraph boy,
but his heart didn't soften; so, still parleying with him in the
porch, I sent the maid to my wife to see what she could do to ease
the financial position.</p>
        <p>The maid returned with a shilling, which was my wife's limit,
and this I tendered to the boy, explaining to him the theory of
discount for net cash. But he was one of those small and obstinate
creatures who won't learn, so I sent him round to the back premises
to get some tea, while I retired to the front to do some thinking.
It was at this moment that Albert chose, imprudently, to make an
important announcement from the top of the stairs with regard to a
first tooth, which he had lost by extraction the day before but had
not yet been able to forget. His idea was that he should come down
and inspect it once more; but I paid no heed to this. His mention
of the matter suggested, when I came to think of it, a solution of
my difficulty with the telegraph boy.</p>
        <p>Later, I asked my wife to step into my study and to shut the
door behind her. "This has become a serious matter," said I; "nay,
it threatens to be a grave scandal. You remember Albert's
tooth?"</p>
        <p>She did. These things are not easily forgotten. "I wish," I
pursued, "to interview Albert's nurse as to it," and I rang the
bell sternly.</p>
        <p>"She hasn't got it," said my wife; "we have," and she took from
the mantelpiece a small packet tied up with pink ribbon.</p>
        <p>I explained that it wasn't the child's molar but the child's
funds that I was concerned with. "You will recollect that I
compensated him for the loss of it with a shilling. It makes it all
the more poignant that it was my last shilling. I put it into his
money-box, the key of which is accessible to miscreants. That
shilling is gone!"</p>
        <p>My wife smiled. "How did you find out?" she asked.</p>
        <p>"I had reason to be looking in the box," I said airily, "and
happened by chance to notice that the shilling had been
stolen."</p>
        <p>"You mean," said she, "that you were proposing to steal it
yourself?"</p>
        <p>I disregarded the question. "I never did trust that nurse," said
I. "But to steal the treasured capital of a defenceless
infant!"</p>
        <p>"I am the thief," said my wife, "and you are the receiver.
Whether or not the telegraph-boy will be jointly charged with us is
for the police and Albert to decide between them."</p>
        <p>At this moment the nurse entered and asked what we required of
her. My wife was confused, but not so I. I told nurse we required
nothing of her but much of Albert. Would she ask him to step
downstairs?</p>
        <p>We assembled in the porch, my wife, Albert, the nurse, and the
telegraph boy. I took the chair.</p>
        <p>"Ladies and gentlemen," said I, "I have a proposal to lay before
the meeting with a view to adjusting the acute crisis. Let me
remind you of the facts:—The gentleman on my right," and I
indicated Albert, whose attention wandered a little, "was recently
possessed of a tooth, two parents, and a godfather of the name of
Carr. The tooth, as teeth will, had to be removed; the parents, as
parents may, advanced a shilling upon it; and the godfather, as
godfathers needn't, telegraphed to say he was coming forthwith to
the <title>locus in quo</title>. Things were so when Mr. (I didn't catch
your name, Sir," and I turned to the telegraph boy) "threatened to
liquidate us unless his debt was satisfied. Business is, as he very
properly remarked, business. "Now for my suggestion: Albert," and I
turned to him again, "will have, the telegram, which, being from
<hi rend="it">his</hi> godfather, is rightly his. He will, however, take it
subject to encumbrances, of which, I understand, he has already
discharged all but threepence. Happily his parents are willing to
withdraw their first charge on his personal assets, and I have much
satisfaction, Sir"—I bowed to the telegraph boy—"in
presenting you with the goods, which were as recently as yesterday
valued at no less than a shilling, and in asking you to keep the
balance as a mark of our unshaken affection and esteem."</p>
        <p>And I handed him Albert's tooth.</p>

        <head>BLANCHE'S LETTERS.<lb/>
            Some Outstanding Features.         </head>
        <p rend="right">
          <hi>Park Lane.</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Dearest <name rend="sc">Daphne</name>,—The outstanding
features of the season have certainly been the Friendship
Fête, the Kamtchatkan Scriptural opera-ballet, "<title>Noé
s'embarque sur l'Arche</title>," and the Cloak!</p>
        <p>The Friendship Fête, to celebrate our not having had any
scraps with any foreign country for some little time, was simply
immense. There were descriptive tableaux and groups, and the one
undertaken by your Blanche—swords being turned into
ploughshares and the figure of Peace standing in the middle, with
Bellona crouching at her feet—was said to be an easy winner.
I was Peace, of course, in chiffon draperies, with my hair down. I
hadn't the faintest notion what sort of thing a ploughshare was,
but I'd clever people to help me, and so it was all right. But oh,
my best one! the difficulty I had in getting a Bellona! They all
wanted to be Peace, and some of them were so absolutely horrid
about it that I couldn't help telling them they were only showing
how <hi rend="it">fit</hi> they were to be Bellona! (I will tell <hi rend="it">you</hi> in
confidence that I believe one of them was responsible for some of
my swords and ploughshares falling down with an immensely odious
crash just as the opening ceremony was going on.) Norty was given
the group of all nations, called, "All Men are Brothers," and he
said on the whole it was rather a rotten job; there was a lot of
friction, and at one time he was afraid things might get almost to
<hi rend="it">diplomatic</hi> lengths; however, it all went smoothly at last.
Still he told me <title>à l'oreille</title> that he was glad it was
well over, as two or three Friendship Fêtes would be enough
to shake the peace of Europe to its foundations!</p>
        <p>But nothing matters much while one can go and see the wonderful,
<hi rend="it">wonderful</hi> Kamtchatkans in "<title>Noé s'embarque sur
l'Arche</title>"—a feast of beauty—a riot of colour—a
mass of inner meanings. Who am I, dearest, that I should try to
word-paint it? Being an opera-ballet, there are two Noahs, a
singing one and a dancing one. While that glorious Golliookin, the
singing Noah, is giving the marvellous Flood Music in a gallery
over the stage, our dear wonderful Ternitenky, the dancing Noah, is
going into the Ark in a series of the most delicious <title>pas
seuls</title>. Then his dance of Astonishment and Alarm as he sees the
waters rising—and afterwards his dance of Joy and
Thankfulness at finding himself quite dry! The <title>Pas de Six</title> of
Noah's Sons and their Wives! And the <hi rend="it">ensemble</hi> dancing of the
Animals! My dearest, you positively must and shall leave your
solitudes and come and see the Kamtchatkans in Scriptural
opera-ballet! Only second to <title>Noé</title> is <title>La Femme de
Lot</title>, with dear Sarkavina, in clouds of white, doing a
sensational whirling dance as she turns into the Pillar, while that
amazing soprano, Scriemalona, sings the mysterious Salt Music.
Bishops quite <hi rend="it">swarm</hi> at these performances. They say they
consider it their <hi rend="it">duty</hi> to go, and that they never
<hi rend="it">really</hi> understood the true character of <name rend="sc">Noah</name> till they saw Ternitenky's beautiful flying leap
into the Ark, or quite grasped the personality of <name rend="sc">Lot</name>'s Wife before seeing Sarkavina's Pillar-of-Salt
dance.</p>
        <p>On <title>Noé</title> and <title>Lot</title> nights it's correct to carry
a little darling Old Testament, bound in velvet or satin to match
or contrast with one's toilette, and generally with jewels on the
cover; and the Old Testament is quite often mentioned at dinner
just now, people pretending they've been reading it, and so on.
<title>À propos</title>, Mrs. Golding-Newman, one of the latest
climbers, excused herself for being late at dinner somewhere the
other night by saying, "I was reading Deuteronomy and didn't notice
how the time was going." The Bullyon-Boundermere woman was present
and, determined to trump her rival's trick, chipped in with, "Oh,
<title>isn't</title> Deuteronomy <hi rend="it">charming</hi>? But I think of <hi rend="it">all</hi>
the books of the Old Testament my favourite is In Memoriam!"</p>
        <p>The Cloak, my Daphne, which is one of the most interesting
arrivals in town this summer, is, <title>à mon avis</title>,
something quite <hi rend="it">more</hi> than a garment—it is a great big
test of all that a woman most prides herself on! You may see a
thousand women with cloaks on, but how many will be <title>really
wearing</title> them! As one criticised the cloaks and their wearers in
the Enclosure at Aswood one couldn't help murmuring with a small
sigh, "Who is sufficient for these things!" People who have the
cloak fastened on <title>in just any way</title>, my dear, are simply
begging the question; in its true inwardness, in its loftiest
development, the cloak should be a separate creation, kept in its
place only by the grace and knack of its wearer. There should be
<hi rend="it">character</hi> about it, a fascinating droop, a sweat crookedness
that can only happen when it is worn with the art that—you
know the rest.</p>
        <p>Shall I confide to you my little secret, dearest? Would you know
why it is given to your Blanche to be easily best of the few women
who do really <hi rend="it">wear</hi> the cloak? When I'm ready, all but nay
cloak, I run away from Yvonne down the stairs; she follows,
carrying the cloak, and when she's beginning to overtake me she
throws the cloak and I catch it on my shoulders. Result—I'm
the envy and despair of all my best beloved enemies!</p>
        <p>People have been trying to find new places to wear their
watches. A small watch on the toe of each shoe (plain for day wear,
jewelled for the evening) had quite a little vogue, though as
watches they were no good, for no one could see the time by them.
Then little teeny watches on the tips of glove-fingers were liked a
little. But the latest development is that Time is
<title>démodé</title>, and anyone mentioning hours and
half-hours is stamped as an outside person.</p>
        <p>Isn't this a <hi rend="it">fragrant</hi> idea about our not being to blame
for anything we do, because it's all owing to the <hi rend="it">colours</hi> we
live with? Everybody's <hi rend="it">charmed</hi> about it. Instead of going to
<hi rend="it">lawyers</hi> when things run off the rails a little, if one just
called in a <title>colour-expert</title> all sorts of horrors might be
avoided, for he would prove that people are like that owing to the
colours of their curtains and upholsteries, and aren't to blame
themselves, poor, dears, the very least little bit! The Thistledown
<title>ménage</title>, for instance. For ages it's been tottery,
because Thistledown never understood Fluffy, and Fluffy, poor
little thing, seemed to understand everybody except Thistledown.
We've all been so sorry for her, for several times he's been on the
point of dragging things into public. And now it turns out that
nothing is Fluffy's fault and that, if she hadn't always had her
own, own room done in pinky-bluey shades, she might have been quite
a serious domestic character! T. says, if that's so, she'd better
have her own, own room done in some other colour, but Fluffy says,
No, she likes pinky-bluey shades, only he must remember, when he's
inclined to be hard on her, that the pinky-blueys are to blame and
not herself.</p>
        <p>Then there's old Lady Humguffin, easily the most miserly old
dear who ever wore a transformation (she even has a taxi-meter
thing in her own motors and anyone driving with her is expected to
pay what it registers!). Colour-experts say that if it weren't for
the frightfully dull dusty purple in which all her rooms are
furnished she might part quite freely!</p>
        <p>So there it is, my dear! People say there's been no such
important discovery since Gallienus—that fearful old man, you
know, who said something moved when everyone else said it didn't.
(I hardly know <hi rend="it">how</hi> I know these things. Please, please don't
think I'm becoming a <title>femme savante</title>!).</p>

        <head>TOO MUCH CHAMPIONSHIP.</head>
        <p>Once life was an easy thing.</p>
        <p>Yorkshire or Surrey or Kent were cricket champions. <name rend="sc">Ranji</name> or W. G. headed the batting averages;
<name rend="sc">Rhodes</name> or <name rend="sc">Richardson</name> the bowling. The office boy who knew these
details plus the Boat Race winner and the English Cup-holders could
keep his end up in conversation. He even found time to do a little
work.</p>
        <p>But now! That poor brain must know that McGinty of Fulham
fetched £1,000 when put up for auction, that the front line
of Blackburn Rovers represents an expense of £11,321
13<title>s.</title> 4<title>d.</title>, and that Chelsea have played before 71,935
spectators. He must know the champions of the First, Second,
Southern, Midland, and Scottish Leagues, and the teams that gained
promotion.</p>
        <p>Then there is cricket—all worked out to "those damned
dots," as Lord <name rend="sc">Randolph</name> said in an inspired
moment. Think of the strain of remembering that Middlesex stands at
78.66 and Surrey at 72.94. And the sporting papers are publishing
lists of catches made; and lists of catches missed are sure to
follow. Think of it—you may have to name the Champion
Butterfingers in 1915!</p>
        <p>Come to tennis. You must know the names of the Australian
Terror, the New Zealand Cyclone, the American Whirlwind. You must
at a glance be able to pronounce on the nationality of Mavrogordato
or Froitzheim. You have the strain of proving that the victory of a
New Zealander over a German proves the vitality of the dear old
country.</p>
        <p>Or boxing. How can an ordinary mind retain the names of all the
White Hopes or Black Despairs. At any moment some Terrible Magyar
may wrest the bantam championship from us. You must learn to
distinguish between <name rend="sc">Wells</name>, the
reconstructor of the universe, and Knock-out <name rend="sc">Wells</name>. You must be acquainted with the doings and
prospects of Dreadnought Brown and Mulekick Jones. You must know
the F. E. Smithian repartees of <name rend="sc">Jack
Johnson</name>.</p>
        <p>Let us talk of golf. No, on second thoughts, let us notably
refrain from talking about golf. Only if you don't know who
defeated <name rend="sc">Travers</name> (<hi rend="it">plus</hi> lumbago) and
who eclipsed America's Bright Boy, you must hide your head in
shame.</p>
        <p>We come to rowing. Once one could stay, "Ah, Leander," and with
an easy shrug of the shoulders pass from the subject. But when
international issues are involved, and the win of a Canadian or
American or German crew may cause <title>The Daily Mail</title> to declare
(for the hundredth time) that England is played out, a man simply
has to keep abreast of the results.</p>
        <p>There are a score of other things. Name for me, if you can, the
Great American Four, the hydro-aeroplane champion, the M.P.
champion pigeon-flyer, and the motor-bike hill-climbing
champion.</p>
        <p>And the Olympic games are coming! Who are England's hopes in the
discus-throwing and the fancy diving? What Britisher must we rely
on in the javelin hop-skip-and-jump?</p>
        <p>Your brain reels at the prospect. We must decide to ignore all
future championships. We must decline to be aggravated if a
Japanese Badminton champion appears. We must cease to be interested
if Britain's Hope beats the Horrible Peruvian at Tiddly-winks.</p>
        <p>There are three admirable reasons for this.</p>
        <p>The first is that we must play some games ourselves.</p>
        <p>The second, that, unless a check be put to championships, the
Parliamentary news will be crowded out of the papers and we shall
find ourselves in an unnatural state of peace and goodwill.</p>
        <p>The third, which one puts forward with diffidence, is that
somebody, somewhere, somehow, sometime must do a little work.</p>

        <head>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</head>
        <head rend="sc">(Extracted from the Diary of Toby,
M.P.)</head>
        <p><hi>House of Commons, Monday, July 6.</hi>—All heads were
bared when the <hi rend="sc">Prime Minister</hi> rose to move
adjournment of <hi rend="sc">House</hi> in sign of sorrow at
the passing way of a great Parliament man. To vast majority of
present House <name rend="sc">Joseph Chamberlain</name> is a
tradition. His personal presence, its commanding force, is varied
and invariable attraction are unknown. Since his final re-election
by faithful Birmingham, where, like the Shunamite woman, he dwelt
among his own people loving and loved, he only once entered the
House.</p>
        <p>It was a tragic scene, perhaps happily witnessed by few.
Appointed business of sitting concluded and Members departed, a
figure that once commanded attention of a listening Senate slowly
entered from behind the <hi rend="sc">Speaker</hi>'s chair. It
was the senior Member for Birmingham come to take the oath. The
action was indicative of his thoroughness and loyalty. No longer
were oaths, rolls of Parliament and seats on either Front Bench
matters of concern to him. His manifold task was done. His
brilliant course was run. But, until he took the oath and signed
the roll, he was not <title>de jure</title> a Member of the House of
Commons, and his vote might not be available by the Whips for a
pair on a critical division.</p>
        <p>Accordingly here he was, moving haltingly with the aid of a
stick, supported by the strong arm of the son whose maiden speech
his old chief <name rend="sc">Gladstone</name> years ago welcomed
as "dear and refreshing to a father's heart." He took the oath and
signed the roll—an historic page in a unique volume. With
dimmed eyes he glanced round the familiar scene of hard fights and
great triumphs, and went forth never to return.</p>
        <p>To-day he lived again in speeches delivered by the <name rend="sc">Prime Minister</name>, by the <name rend="sc">Leader of the Opposition</name>, and by the Cabinet
         colleague and leader to whom he was loyal to the last. The
         practice of delivering set eulogies to the memory of the
         departed great is the most difficult that falls to the lot of
         a Leader on either side of House of Commons. In some hands it
         has uncontrollable tendency to the artificiality and
         insipidity of funeral baked meats. <name rend="sc">Disraeli</name> was a failure on such occasions;
         <name rend="sc">Gladstone</name> at his best. <name rend="sc">Prince Arthur</name>, usually supreme, did not
         to-day reach his accustomed lofty level.</p>
        <p>In fineness of tone and exquisite felicity of phrasing,
<name rend="sc">Asquith</name> excelled himself. The first time
the House of Commons caught a glimpse of profound depths of a
nature habitually masked by impassive manner and curt speech was
when he talked to it in broken voice about <name rend="sc">Campbell-Bannerman</name>, just dead. Speaking this afternoon
about one with whom, as he said, he "had exchanged many blows," he
was even more impressive, not less by reason of the eloquence of
his speech than by its simplicity and sincerity.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>When figures were announced <name rend="sc">Lord Crewe</name>,
reminiscent of the farmer smacking his lips over a liqueur glass of
old brandy, remarked to <name rend="sc">Viscount Morley</name>, "I
should like some more of that in a moog."</p>
        <p><title>Tuesday.</title>—Interesting episode preceded main business
of sitting. Sort of rehearsal of meeting of Parliament on College
Green. Opened by <name rend="sc">Sheehan</name> rising from Bench
partially filled by O'Brienites to move issue of new writ for North
Galway. Had it been an English borough nothing particular would
have happened. Writ would have been ordered as matter of course,
and there an end on't.</p>
        <p>Things different on College Green. When <name rend="sc">Sheehan</name> sat down, up gat <name rend="sc">Captain
Donelan</name> from Redmondite camp, which when moved to Dublin will,
by reason of numerical majority, be analogous to Ministerialists at
Westminister. <name rend="sc">Donelan</name> remarked that in his
capacity as Nationalist Whip he intended to move issue of writ next
Monday. This fully explained why <name rend="sc">O'Brien</name>'s
young man moved it to-day.  Otherwise cause of quarrel obscure. What
they fought each other for dense mind of Saxon could not make out.</p>
        <p>Ambiguity partly due to <name rend="sc">Donelan</name>. Lacking
the volubility common to his countrymen he had prepared heads of
his speech jotted down on piece of notepaper. This so intricately
folded that sequence of remarks occasionally suffered. Situation
further complicated by accidental turning over of notes upside
down. House grateful when presently <name rend="sc">Tim
Healy</name> interposed. He being past-master of lucid statement,
we should now know all about circumstances which apparently, to the
temporary shouldering aside of Ulster, rocked Ireland to its
centre.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately <name rend="sc">Tim</name> was embarrassed by
attempt to assume a novel oratorical attitude. Usually he addresses
House with studied carelessness of hands lightly clasped behind his
back. Presumably in consideration of supreme national importance of
the question whether <name rend="sc">Sheehan</name> should move
issue of writ to-day or <name rend="sc">Donelan</name> on Monday,
he essayed a new attitude. It recalled <name rend="sc">Napoleon</name> at Fontainebleau folding his arms majestically
as he bade farewell to remnant of the Old Guard.</p>
        <p>Attempt, several times repeated, proved a failure. Somehow or
other <name rend="sc">Tim</name>'s arms would not adjust
themselves <pb xml:id="page74" n="pg 74"/> to novel circumstances, and fell back
into the old <title>laissez-faire</title> position. Speech repeatedly
interrupted on points of order by compatriots on back benches. What
was clear was that some one had filed a petition in bankruptcy.
Identity of delinquent not so clear.</p>
        <p>However, as a foretaste of debate in Home Rule Parliament,
proceedings interesting and instructive. Disposed of slanderous
suggestions of disorder. Never, or hardly ever, was a more decorous
debate. To it <name rend="sc">Swift MacNeill</name>, prospective
first Speaker of a modern Irish Parliament, lent the dignity and
authority of his patronage. Pretty to see him, as debate went
forward, glancing aside at his wigged-and-gowned brother in the
Chair, as who should say, "What do you think of this, Sir?"</p>
        <p><title>Business done.</title>—With assistance of Ministerial
forces, O'Brienite motion for issue of writ for Galway defeated by
Redmondite amendment to adjourn debate. <name rend="sc">William
O'Brien</name> took swift revenge. House dividing on <name rend="sc">Premier</name>'s motion allotting time for remaining stages of
Budget Bill, he led his little flock into Opposition Lobby,
assisting to reduce Ministerial majority to figure of 23. In this
labour of love he found himself assisted by abstention of two
groups of Ministerialists, one objecting to procedure on Finance
Bill, the other thirsting for blood of the Ulster gun-runners.</p>
        <p>If <name rend="sc">Premier</name> still hesitates about Autumn
Session this incident should help him to make up his mind. The
Government will be safer with its Members on the moors or the golf
links than daily running the gauntlet at Westminster.</p>
        <p><title>House of Lords, Thursday.</title>—When noble lords take
their legislative business seriously in hand they show the Commons
a better way. Their dealing with the Amending Bill has been a model
of businesslike procedure. Speeches uniformly brief because kept
strictly to the point. Amendments carefully considered in council
and moved from Front Opposition Bench were carried by large
majorities.</p>
        <p><title>Business done.</title>—Home Rule Amending Bill turned
inside out in two sittings. Own father wouldn't know it.
<name rend="sc">Sark</name> sums up situation by paraphrase of
historic saying. "They have," he remarks, "made a new Bill and call
it Peace."</p>

        <p>The prospects of the forthcoming campaign in the East
Worcestershire Division have been greatly brightened by the
decision of the well-known sportsman, Mr. Otis Q. Janaway, to stand
as an Independent Candidate with the express purpose of speeding-up
the British Legislature. Mr. Janaway, who graduated in sociology at
the University of Pensacola, and has recently been naturalised as a
British subject, has brought with him a team of baseball players,
four white and four coloured prize-fighters, and a chorus of
variety artistes who will appear and sing at all his meetings. He
is a powerful speaker with a great fund of anecdote, and his
programme includes Compulsory Phonetic Spelling, the establishment
of Christian Science, Electrocution, and the introduction of
College Yells in Parliament. If her husband is elected, Mrs.
Janaway has announced her intention of embracing the Speaker at the

        <p>Professor Thaddeus Mulhooly, who was until recently President of
the University of Tuskahoma, has taken up his residence at
Ballybunnion with a view to qualifying as Parliamentary Candidate
for North Kerry. Professor Mulhooly, whose grandparents resided at
Tralee, has made a very favourable impression by the filial
affection shown in his election war-cry, which runs, "Tralee,
Trala, Tara Tarara, Tzing Boum Oshkosh." His platform is that of a
Pan-Celtic Vegetarian, and he has secured the influential support
of Mr. <name rend="sc">Upton Sinclair</name>, who is acting as his
election agent, and who publicly embraced him at a meeting at
Dingle last week.</p>

        <p>General Amos Cadwalader Stunt, the well-known Colorado mining
magnate, who recently purchased the Isle of Rum, has announced his
intention of contesting the Elgin Burghs in the Liquid Paraffin
interest. At a political meeting at Lossiemouth last week he held
the attention of a crowded audience for upwards of an hour, during
which his bodyguard serenaded him with mouth-organs and banjos, the
interruptions of hecklers having been effectually discounted by a
liberal distribution of chewing gum. At the close of this great
effort General Stunt was publicly embraced by his wife's mother,
Mrs. Titania Flagler.</p>

Thursday with a demonstration in favour of Mr. Cyrus P. Slocum, the
eminent Pittsburg safety razor magnate, who has been selected by
the Association of American Manufacturers in England to represent
their interests at Westminster. Before Mr. Slocum rose the audience
sang "My Country, 'tis of Thee" continuously for forty-five minutes
and waved the Stars and Stripes for fully twenty minutes longer.
Finally, the popular candidate was carried shoulder-high from the
platform to his motor and smothered with kisses from his
compatriots, the vast assemblage dispersing to the jocund strains
of "John Brown's Body."</p>

a pianola, carving or waiting at table if required?</p>

        <head>ONCE UPON A TIME.<lb/>
The Power of the Press.         </head>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a quiet respectable little
spell-of-hot-weather, with no idea of being a nuisance or doing
more than warm people up a bit, and make the summer really feel
like summer, and add attraction to seaside resorts. Directly it
reached our shores every one began to be happy; and they would have
gone on being so but for the sub-editors, who cannot leave well
alone but must be for ever finding adjectives for it and teasing it
with attentions. Just then they were particularly free to turn
their attentions to the kindly visitor, because there was no good
murder at the moment, and no divorce case, and no spicy society
scandal, and therefore their pages were in need of filling. And
seeing the little spell-of-hot-weather they gave way to their
passion for labelling everything with crisp terseness—or
terse crispness (I forget which)—and called it a "heat wave,"
and straightway began to give it half the paper, and with huge
headings such as, "<hi name="sc">The Heat-Wave</hi>,"
"<hi name="sc">Heat-Wave Still Growing</hi>," "<hi name="sc">80
in the Shade</hi>," "<hi name="sc">How to Support such
Weather</hi>," so that the nice little spell-of-hot-weather was
gradually goaded into the desire really to justify this
excitement.</p>
        <p>"Very well," it said, "I never meant to be more than 80 in the
shade and a pleasant interlude in the usual disappointing English
June; but since they're determined I'm a nuisance I'll be one. I'll
go up to 84."</p>
        <p>And it did. It reached 84; and the wise people who like warmth
said, "How splendid! If only it would go on like this for ever! Not
hotter—just like this.".</p>
        <p>But the sub-editors were not satisfied. They had got hold of a
good thing and they meant to run it for all it was worth. So
"<hi name="sc">Hotter than Ever</hi>" they sprawled across
their papers, there still being nothing of real public interest to
distract them, "<hi name="sc">Hotter Tomorrow</hi>,"
"<hi name="sc">Heat-Wave Growing</hi>," "<hi name="sc">Terrible Heat</hi>."</p>
        <p>And now the spell-of-hot-weather was stimulated to be really
vicious. "I call Heaven to witness," it said, "that my sole desire
was to be genial and beneficial. But what can one do when one is
taunted and provoked, abused and nick-named like this? Very well
then, I'll go up to 90!"</p>
        <p>And it did. The sub-editors were delighted. "<hi name="sc">Appalling Heat</hi>," they wrote, "<hi name="sc">Tropical
England</hi>," "<hi name="sc">Gasping London</hi>,"
"<hi name="sc">Heat-Wave Breaks all Records</hi>,"
"<hi name="sc">Hottest Day for Fifty Years</hi>,"
"<hi name="sc">No Signs of Relief</hi>."</p>
        <p>And even the people who like warmth began to grumble a
little—hypnotised by the Press. But the spell-of-hot-weather
had had enough. "I'll go somewhere else, where I'm really welcome
and they don't have contents bills," it said, and it crossed the
Channel to Paris. It looked back to the English shores, deserted
now by the happy paddlers and bathers and baskers of the days
before. "I'm sorry to leave you," it said, "but don't blame
me."</p>
        <p>Yet the public did.</p>

        <p rend="it">[It has been suggested that spectators at popular golf
competitions should be installed in grand stands and other
enclosures, and be restrained from wandering about the
links.]</p>
        <p>In playing his tee shot from in front of the Green Steward's
marquee, Mr. Tullbrown-Smith, who took the honour in the final
round of the 1916 Amateur Championship, unfortunately pulled his
ball, with the result that, narrowly missing the Actors' Benevolent
Fund stand, it entered the grand ducal box. The Grand Duke Raphael
graciously decided that Mr. Tullbrown-Smith should be presented to
His Imperial Highness before playing out. Pardonable nervousness
proved fatal to the shot, which, being badly topped, fell into the
Press pen, where it was photographed by <title>The Daily Mirror's</title>
special artist before it could be recovered by its owner.</p>
        <milestone rend="stars" unit="rule"/>
        <p>It is interesting to record that along the straight mile boarded
by the shilling enclosure Mr. Tanquery McBrail, who had been
playing with marvellously decorative effect, had his ball blown
into the bunker at the tenth by the laughter of the less
well-informed onlookers, while a regrettable incident was the
contribution of several empty ginger-beer bottles to the natural
difficulties of the hazard.</p>
        <milestone rend="stars" unit="rule"/>
        <p>Some dissatisfaction was expressed among the occupants of the
cinema operators' cage. From the position allotted to them by the
publicity committee it was impossible to film the most interesting
moments in the Championship round, such as Mr. Tullbrown-Smith's
acceptance of a peeled banana from his caddie on emerging from the
particularly scenic bunker known as "Hell." Also a fine "picture"
was missed at the 13th tee, where Mr. Tanquery McBrail was
surrounded by a militant suffragist, who had invaded the course in
spite of the rabbit-wire and double <title>chevaux-de-frise</title>.</p>
        <milestone rend="stars" unit="rule"/>
        <p>Owing to the fact that the fashionable audience assembled in the
Guards', Cavalry and Bath Club stands insisted upon encoring both
players' wonderful putts at the 16th green, and the consequent
delay of nearly ten minutes, there were some rather ugly
manifestations of impatience in the cheaper seats. In spite of the
fact that the Pale Pink Pierrots had been specially engaged to fill
the interval before the finalists passed, they were so loudly booed
upon their arrival that Mr. Tanquery McBrail put his mashie
approach into the Parliamentary compound, amidst the jeers and
hoots of the more unruly, who seemed to forget that the royal and
ancient game is not a music-hall entertainment.</p>
        <milestone rend="stars" unit="rule"/>
        <p>The fact that the links marshal had placed all the professional
players present in one row of fauteuils, opposite the long carry to
the 18th green, hardly seemed to further the interests of perfect
golf. The warmest acknowledgments are therefore due to a number of
ex-open champions, who kindly turned their backs on what proved one
of the most distressing episodes in the day's play.</p>

        <head>A MARK OF DISTINCTION.</head>
        <p>When I passed our butcher's on my way to the station yesterday
morning, I noticed outside his shop a placard prominently
displayed, which read:—"Williamson's Spring Lamb. So
different from the ordinary butchers."</p>
        <p>There was no apostrophe before the "s" in "butchers," so the
reference was clearly to Williamson and not Williamson's Spring
Lamb.</p>
        <p>"Is Williamson really different from his rivals?" I said to
myself, crossing to the other side of the road to take a general
survey of the shop front. No, the same sort of joints seemed to be
hanging up as those in other butchers' windows; the same sort of
legends attached to those which passers-by were invited to note
particularly.</p>
        <p>I crossed the road again. Yes, as I feared. There were several
ordinary flies and at least one bluebottle exercising themselves on
the meat. The choice cutlets were not isolated or decorated with
garlands, or made a fuss of in any way. They just fraternised on
terms of equality with the rest. The usual "young lady" in a smart
blouse, with her bare pink neck served up in a ham-frill, sat
behind the usual window, probably trying to work out the usual sums
in butcher's arithmetic.</p>
        <p>The top half of Mr. Williamson was visible behind his
chopping-table. He saw me and touched his hat—a bowler;
nothing very extraordinary about the bowler. The brim was certainly
a great deal flatter than I like personally, but quite in keeping
with the general tastes of those who purvey meat.</p>
        <p>I thought it better to postpone further investigations, and
reflected that Honor might be able to enlighten me when I returned
home that evening.</p>
        <p>"No," she said, when I asked her about it, "I haven't noticed
anything exceptionally superior about him."</p>
        <p>"Bills any different?"</p>
        <p>"No," she said, "they take as long to pay; about as exorbitant
as most of the others."</p>
        <p>"Have you observed anything peculiar about his manners, then?" I
said; "does he ever throw chops at you, for instance, when you pass
the shop?"</p>
        <p>"No such luck," said Honor; "I'm a good catch."</p>
        <p>"Perhaps they give you tea," I said, "when you make an afternoon
call on the sirloins?"</p>
        <p>"Indeed they don't," said Honor, "not even when I go to pay
something off the book."</p>
        <p>"Then perhaps you have cosy little auction bridge parties in the
room behind the cashier's window? No? Butchers are behind the
times."</p>
        <p>"There ought," said Honor, "to be a good joke to be made out of
that—a newspaper joke; but I can't quite see how to make it
just yet."</p>
        <p>"That's something to the good," I said. "However, to our
muttons."</p>
        <p>"Rotten," said Honor.</p>
        <p>"What of his entourage?" I said, ignoring her comment; "his
steak-bearer and the like?"</p>
        <p>"Nothing unusual; just <title>épris</title> with Emily."</p>
        <p>"Then where, oh where," I said, "is this difference that
Williamson brags about?"</p>
        <p>"I don't know," Honor said helplessly.</p>
        <p>"I shall find out," I said, "even if I have to do the
housekeeping myself for a bit."</p>
        <p>"You can take it on," she said, "when you like."</p>
        <milestone rend="stars" unit="rule"/>
        <p>"Aha!" I said triumphantly, as I burst into the room this
evening. "I've solved the Williamson problem. He was standing at
his door as I passed just now, in all the regalia of his dread
office."</p>
        <p>"And you went up to him and said, 'Well, what about it?' and
pointed to the notice, I suppose."</p>
        <p>"Not at all," I said; "I merely looked at him and the scales
fell from my eyes. He butches in spats."</p>

        <head rend="it">(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</head>
        <p><name rend="sc">Ellen Melicent Cobden</name> can certainly
            not be accused of writing too hurriedly. I don't know how
            many years it is since, as "<name rend="sc">Miles
            Amber</name>," she captured my admiration with that
            wonderful first novel, <title>Wistons</title>; and now
            here is her second, <title>Sylvia Saxon</title> (<name rend="sc">Unwin</name>), only just appearing. I may say at
            once that it entirely confirms my impression that she is a
            writer of very real and original gifts. <title>Sylvia
            Saxon</title> is not a pleasant book. It is hard, more
            than a little bitter, and deliberately unsympathetic in
            treatment. But it is grimly real. <title>Sylvia</title>
            herself is a character that lives, and her mother, Rachel,
            almost eclipses her in this same quality of tragic
            vitality. The whole tale is a tragedy of empty and
            meaningless lives passed in an atmosphere of too much
            money and too little significance. The "society" of a
            Northern manufacturing plutocracy, the display and
            rivalry, the marriages between the enriched families, the
            absence of any standard except wealth—all these things are
            set down with the minute realism that must come, I am
            sure, of intimate personal
            knowledge. <title>Sylvia</title> is the offspring of one
            such family, and mated to the decadent heir of
            another. Her tragedy is that too late she meets a man whom
            she supposes capable of giving her the fuller, more
            complete life for which she has always ignorantly yearned.
            Then there is <title>Anne</title>, the penniless girl,
            hired as a child to be a playfellow for
            <title>Sylvia</title>, who herself loves the same man, and
            dies when his dawning affection is ruthlessly swept away
            from her by the dominant personality of
            <title>Sylvia</title>. A tale, one might call it, of
            unhappy women; not made the less grim by the fact that the
            man for whom they fought is shown as wholly unworthy of
            such emotion. A powerful, disturbing and highly original
            story.</p>

        <p>"<name rend="sc">Saki</name>" has been now for a number of
years a great delight to me, and his last work, <title>Beasts and
Super-Beasts</title> (<name rend="sc">Lane</name>), is as good as any
of its predecessors. Clothed in the elegant garments of
<title>Clovis</title> or <title>Reginald</title>, Mr. <name rend="sc">Munro</name>
makes plain to us how lovely this world might be were we only a
little bolder about our practical jokes. In the art of introducing
bears into the boudoir of a countess or pigs into the study of a
diplomat, and then clinching the matter with the wittiest of
epigrams, <title>Clovis</title> is supreme. He knows, too, an immense
amount about the vengeance that children may take upon their
relations, and ladies upon their lady friends. I like him
especially when he manœuvres some stupid but kind-hearted
woman into a situation of whose peril she herself is only cloudily
aware, while the reader knows all about it. That is the fun of the
whole thing. The reader is for ever assisting <title>Clovis</title> and
<title>Reginald</title>; in the course of their daring adventures he
connives from behind curtains, through key-holes, from ambushes in
trees, and always, whilst the poor creature is being harried by
wild boars or terrified by menacing kittens, <title>Clovis</title> may be
observed, with finger on lip, begging of the intelligent reader
that he will not give things away. Of the present collection of
stories I like best "A Touch of Realism," <pb xml:id="page80" n="pg 80"/> "The
Byzantine Omelette," "The Boar-Pig," and "The Dreamer;" but all are
good, and I can only hope that it will not be too long before
<title>Clovis</title> once again invites us to further delightful
conspiracies.</p>
        <milestone rend="hr" unit="rule"/>
        <p><title>Ars est celara artem</title>, and not to define and emphasise it
in a foreword to the reader. The motive of <title>The Last Shot</title>
(<name rend="sc">Chapman and Hall</name>) appears in due course in
the narrative; I would have preferred to discover it gradually for
myself rather than have the essence of it extracted and poured into
me in advance. The preface has not the excuse of a mere
advertisement; to open this book at any point is to read the whole,
and every page is the strongest possible incentive to the reading
of the others. If (as is not admitted) any personal explanation was
necessary, it should have been put at the end and in small type so
that those who, like myself, detest explanations might have avoided
this one. I am the more severe about this, because there can be no
two opinions as to Mr. <name rend="sc">Frederick Palmer</name>'s
success in achieving his purpose, which, obviously, was to conceive
modern warfare as between two First-class Powers, fighting in the
midst of civilisation, and to reduce it to terms of exact realism,
showing the latest devices of destruction at work, but carefully
excluding those improbable and impossible agencies which the more
exuberant but less informed novelist loves to imagine and put in
play. Mr. <name rend="sc">Palmer</name>'s conception, though based
upon some experience, is for the most part speculative, of course,
but I am confident that he gives us an excellent idea of how the
military machine would work in practice, how its human constituent
parts would feel inwardly, and what physical and moral effects a
battle would have upon those civilians who inhabited and owned the
battlefield. Whether or no the future will prove the truth of the
author's somewhat Utopian conclusions, he certainly founds them
upon a most exciting and convincing story, in which the "love
interest" is as powerful as could be desired.</p>
        <milestone rend="hr" unit="rule"/>
        <p>Would you like to pay a round of visits to some delightful
Shropshire houses, as the friend and guest of a charming woman, who
knows all about what is most interesting in all of them, and has a
pleasantly chatty manner of telling it? Of course you would; so
would anyone. That is why I predict another success for Lady
<name rend="sc">Catherine Milnes Gaskell</name>'s latest
house-book, <title>Friends Round the Wrekin</title> (<name rend="sc">Smith, Elder</name>). Perhaps you have pleasant memories of
her former volumes in the same kind; if so, I need say no more by
way of introduction; but, if not, I must tell you that her new book
is very fairly described, in the words of the publisher, as "a
further collection of history and legend, garden lore and character
study." What the publishers modestly refrain from mentioning is the
real charm with which it has been written, a quality that makes all
the difference. There are also photographs of a number of wholly
fascinating houses (the kind that make me wistful when I see them
in the auctioneers' windows), and the author has some personal
anecdote or quaint scrap of legend to tell you about each. I am
quite willing to admit that the rambling book has increased lately
to an extent imperfectly justified by its average quality. Too many
of them confuse rambling with drivelling. But for the reflections
of a cultivated woman, one who has steeped herself in the lore of a
country she evidently loves, and can transcribe it with such tender
and persuasive charm, there should always be room. I may
add—and your own tastes must decide whether this is a flaw or
a fresh merit—that Lady <name rend="sc">Catherine</name>'s
sympathies, political and social, are undisguisedly with the past,
and that the "Education of the People" comes in, upon almost every
other page, for as shrewd raps as her gentle nature will allow her
to administer.</p>

Because then, if I ever chanced to wake up suddenly and find that I
had been drugged in my sleep, and the six immense rubies, brought
here from the East by a far-off ancestor and set in a black agate
shield above my bed, to represent the "six <hi rend="it">gouttes</hi> (or
drops) <hi rend="it">gules</hi> on a field <hi rend="it">sable</hi>" of my immemorial
coat-of-arms, had been rudely reaved from me in the night by my
cousin, who had sent one each to his six sons, I should have no
fear. I should feel perfectly convinced that in a short time, by my
own personal exertions, but without exercising the least particle
of intelligence, I should recover those six rubies (representing
six <hi rend="it">gouttes</hi> or drops <hi rend="it">gules</hi>) and replace them in the
black agate shield (representing a field <hi rend="it">sable</hi>); and
naturally enough, like the autobiographical hero of <title>The Six
Rubies</title> (representing——I beg your pardon, I mean,
published by <name rend="sc">Ward, Lock</name>), I should not
dream of calling in the aid of the police. Another jolly thing that
would inspirit me would be the fact that each of my adventures in
search of the missing jewels would conform to a separate and
well-known type of magazine story: there would be one fire, one
notorious cracksman, one haunted castle, one cabinet with a secret
drawer, and so on. There would be plenty of excitement, plenty of
hairbreadth escapes. But I think that, when collating my
experiences and putting them into six-shilling form, I should
delete some of the tautologous references to the past which are one
of the stern necessities of serial publication. Otherwise my
readers might begin to feel slightly fatigued by my six ancestral
<hi rend="it">gouttes</hi>. They might even begin to feel that they did not
much care if I had hereditary sciatica.</p>

        <p>Hearing from an undergraduate
friend at Cardinal College of the impending
retirement of Mr. Chumbleton
("Old Chum"), the famous porter of
Salisbury Gate, I gladly seized the
opportunity of running down to Oxford
to gain some fresh sidelights on the
inner life of the University. Cardinal
College, unlike Balliol, Magdalen and
New College, has never shown itself
responsive to the new spirit. There
are probably fewer Socialists in Peckover
than in any other quad in Oxford.
The old feudal traditions, though somewhat
mitigated, still survive. You still
hear the characteristic Mayfair accent
and recognise a curious lack of that
Moral Uplift without which, as Sir
<name rend="sc">Robertson Nicoll</name> finely says, a man is
no better than a mummy. And yet I own
to having been strangely attracted by
these well-groomed scions of a vanishing
breed, with their finely chiselled
features, their clipped colloquialisms
and their cheerful arrogance. There is
something engaging as well as pathetic
in these unruffled countenances, blind
to the realities of modern life and the
need of that fraternal fellowship which
alone can bring peace to the head that
wears a crown or a coronet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chumbleton, who was just going
off duty when I arrived, cordially invited
me into his inner sanctum and
offered me a glass of gin and green
Chartreuse, the favourite beverage, he
assured me, of the late Duke of Midhurst,
whose scout he had been in
the "seventies." Of that strange and
meteoric figure, who was subsequently
devoured by a crocodile on the Blue
Nile, Mr. Chumbleton spoke with
genuine affection. "He was something
like a Dook," said the old man, "and
not one of your barley-water-drinking
faddists. Yes, in those days a Dook was
a Dook and not a cock-shy for demigods
[? demagogues]. I can remember,"
he went on, "when there wore three
Dooks in residence at the same time,
the Dook of Midhurst, the Dook of
St. Ives and the Dook of Clumber.
But the Dook of Midhurst was the
pick of the bunch. Why, once he went
into a grocer's shop in the High and
asked for two pounds of treacle. 'How
will you have it?' asked the grocer,
who was the baldest-headed man I ever
seen. 'In my hat,' said the Dook,
whipping off his bowler and holding it
out. As soon as it was full, before you
could say Jack Robinson, he popped
it on the grocer's head and ran out of
the shop."</p>
        <p>The old man told this terrible story,
which reminded me of the worst
cruelties of the despots of the Italian
Renaissance, with a gusto that was
inexpressibly painful. When he had
finished I asked whether the Duke was
sent down. "Oh, no, Sir," was the
prompt response. "You see the grocer,
being a bald-headed man, had no
trouble with the treacle, and, besides,
the Dook he gave him a wig next day.
But if anyone was to do that to-day,
Dook or no Dook, there'd be questions
asked about it in the House of Commons,
or a Royal Commission would
be appointed. Times is changed," he
went on sadly, "and there ain't any
more of the old stock left. Why, the
Bullingdon Club got three First Classes
this year, and as for breaking up furniture
and bonfires in the quad it don't
happen once in three years. 'Nuts'
they call 'em now, but when I was a
young scout they called 'em 'dogs,' and
gay dogs they were, I can tell you.
'Bloods' they call 'em, too, but there
ain't much blue blood in these modern
Blutocrats."</p>
        <p>I asked Mr. Chumbleton if there
were any signs of Cardinal College
being affected by the new Moral Uplift,
but he seemed unable to fathom the
meaning of my query. His standpoint
was clearly philistine and, I regret to
say, distinctly pagan. He had never
heard of the Land Campaign, or of
Mr. <name rend="sc">Hemmerde</name>, Baron <name rend="sc">de Forest</name> or
even Mr. <name rend="sc">Harold Begbie</name>. His attitude
towards Mr. <name rend="sc">Lloyd George</name> was unsympathetic.
He deplored the popularity
of motor-bicycles, but, with a
strange and lamentable perversity, welcomed
the advent of the motor-'bus
while condemning the introduction of
trams.</p>
        <p>I came away more than ever impressed
by the tenacity of feudal traditions,
and the need of redoubled efforts
on the part of all Radical stalwarts to
convert the older universities from hotbeds
of expensive obscurantism into
free nurseries of humanitarian democracy.
It was sad to see such a
figure as that of Mr. Chumbleton,
genial and hospitable, I admit, but
utterly heedless of the trend of the
times, hopelessly ignorant of the Progressive
program, and deriving a senile
satisfaction from memories of a barbarous
and brutal past.</p>

        <head>ONCE UPON A TIME.</head>
        <p rend="center">
          <name rend="sc">Transmigration.</name>
        </p>
        <p>Once upon a time there was an
ostrich who, though very ostrichy, was
even more of an egoist. He thought
only of himself. That is not a foible
peculiar to ostriches, but this particular
fowl—and he was very particular—was
notable for it. "Where do I come in?"
was a question written all over him—from
his ridiculous and inadequate head,
down his long neck, on his plump
fluffy body, and so to his exceedingly
flat and over-sized feet.</p>
        <p>It was in Afric's burning sand—to
be precise, at the Cape—that, on the
approach of danger, the ostrich secreted
his self-centred head, and here from
time to time his plumes were plucked
from him for purposes of trade.</p>
        <p>Now it happened that in London
there was a theatre given up to a season
of foreign opera, and, this theatre
having been built by one of those
gifted geniuses so common among
theatre architects, it followed that the
balcony (into which, of course, neither
the architect nor the manager for whom
it was built had ever strayed) contained
a number of seats from which
no view of the stage was visible at all—unless
one stood up, and then the people
behind were deprived of their view.
This, of course, means nothing to
architects or managers. The thought
that jolly anticipatory parties of simple
folk bent upon a happy evening may
be depressed and dashed by a position
suffering from such disabilities could
not concern architects and managers,
for some imagination would be needed
to understand it.</p>
        <p>The new temporary management,
however (whatever the ordinary management
might do), recognising the
rights of the spectator, refrained from
selling any seats from which no view
whatever could be obtained and behaved
very well about it—as perhaps one has
to do when half-a-guinea is charged for
each seat; but with the border-line
seats which they did sell—those on the
confines of the possible area—- a view
of the stage was only partial and so
much a matter of touch-and-go that any
undue craning of the neck or moving
of the head sideways at once interrupted
the line of vision of many worthy folk
at the back; while anyone leaning too
far forward from a seat in the front
row could instantly, for many others,
obliterate the whole stage.</p>
        <p>It happened that on a certain very
hot night in July a fat lady in one of
the front seats not only leaned forward
but fanned herself intermittently with
a large fan.</p>
        <p>Now and then one of the unfortunate
half-guinea seat-holders behind her in
the debatable territory remonstrated
gently and politely, remarking on the
privation her fan was causing to others,
and each time the lady smiled and said
she was very sorry and put the fan
down; but in two minutes she was
fluttering it again as hard as ever, and
not a vestige of the Pentateuchal caperings
or whatever was going forward
could be discerned in her vicinity.</p>
        <p>She meant well, poor lady; but it
was very hot, and how could she help
it when her fan was made of that particular
ostrich's feathers?</p>

        <head>MY TROUSSEAU.</head>
        <p>Having been a bachelor from my
earliest youth I suppose I ought to be
accustomed to the condition; but the
fact remains that I miss something—something
which only a wedding
supplies.</p>
        <p>Curiously enough this want is not a
wife. I have been without one so long
that I should not know what to do
with her if I had one. I should probably
overlook her, and she would become
atrophied or die of neglect or
thirst. Neither do I crave a home of
my own; nor golden-haired children to
climb up my knee. I can do without
these accessories.</p>
        <p>But what I do hunger for and what
I <hi rend="it">will</hi> have is a trousseau. Why the
acquisition of a trousseau should be a
purely feminine prerogative
I have never been able to
understand. A bride without
a trousseau is generally
regarded as an incomplete
thing—a poached-egg without
toast; a salad without
dressing. But the bridegroom
without a trousseau
is a recognised institution.
True, he has new clothes,
both seen and unseen, but
this is not a trousseau; it is
merely a "replenishment of
his wardrobe." His least
disreputable old things are
"made to do"; and nobody
thinks slightingly of him
if he attends his wedding
in a re-cuffed shirt or in
boots that have been resoled.
A girl, however,
would as soon think of
entering Paradise with a second-hand
halo as she would contemplate being
married in anything that was not
aggressively new.</p>
        <p>Thus it is that before my wish can
be consummated I have two honoured
conventions to defy: that only a girl
may possess a trousseau, and that a
marriage is a necessary condition to
the acquiring of it. Fortunately I
am strong-minded. A long course of
Mrs. <name rend="sc">Humphry Ward</name>'s homilies has
given me no little facility in achieving
this attribute, and I am determined
that I will change neither my sex nor
my status.</p>
        <p>Now, I have prepared a list, just as—I
suppose—every girl does. In the
first place I am going to indulge in
the hitherto undreamt-of luxury of a
surfeit of dress-shirts. No one who
has not experienced life on two dress-shirts—one
in wear, the other in the
wash—can quite understand what this
will mean to me. Men like Sir <name rend="sc">Joseph
Beecham</name>, Mr. <name rend="sc">Mallaby-Deeley</name>, Mr.
<name rend="sc">Solly Joel</name>, Lord <name rend="sc">Howard de Walden</name>,
and others, who, I daresay, have four
or even five, cannot know what it is
to feel that their evening's refreshment
and entertainment depend on
their finding the French chalk or the
india-rubber.</p>
        <p>Therefore I am making no stint in
this matter. I am having fifteen dress-shirts,
so that there may be one for
wear each day in the week, seven in
the laundry, and one over for emergencies—like
<title>Parsifal</title>, that begins
in the middle of the afternoon. I mean
to be similarly lavish in the matter of
collars and handkerchiefs. The number
of the former which I am buying
amounts almost to an epidemic; while
the extent of my commission in the
latter is the result of lessons learnt in
the hard school of experience. I say
unhesitatingly that the man who tries
to get through life on a mere dozen
handkerchiefs is simply begging for
disaster, as, however methodical in
their use he may be, a carelessly-caught
cold may any day upset his reckoning
and leave him at a loose end; sometimes
scarcely that. Hence I am doing
this part of my trousseau in princely
fashion. I am having half a gross of
them.</p>
        <p>Then there is my slumber-wear. For
years I have hungered for silk ones,
but have had no conscientious excuse
for appeasing my appetite. To buy silk
pyjamas in cold blood has hitherto
seemed to me to be sheer cynical extravagance;
but now I feel that circumstances
justify me in my action,
for it would be a very sorry thing for
me to encounter a burglar or cope with
a fire clad in apparel that would not
be up to the standard of the rest of my
wardrobe.</p>
        <p>Now, I am a great believer in dressing
for the spirit of the moment; therefore
I have resolved upon a pretty colour-scheme
for my night-wear. My pyjamas
are to be of tints conducive to refreshing
rest, namely and severally white,
lemon, light pink, and pale green—an
idea which I candidly confess was inspired
by the spectacle of a Neapolitan
ice. If you think that this is merely
an idle whim, just imagine endeavouring
to sleep in pyjamas patterned like
an Axminster carpet or a Scotch tartan.
No wonder <title>Macbeth</title> "murdered sleep"
if he was arrayed in garments of his
club-colours!</p>
        <p>I have brought the same æsthetic
sense to bear upon my choice of ties
and socks: greys and blacks for times
of grave political crises; fawn, buff,
pearl, moose—I am not sure that this
is a colour, but it sounds
quite possible—for brighter
hours; and colours familiar
to every student of spectroscopy
for halcyon days of
rejoicing—the opening of
the Royal Academy, the
Handel Festival, the return
of <name rend="sc">Harry Lauder</name>, or the
elevation of Mr. <name rend="sc">Bernard
Shaw</name> to the peerage.</p>
        <p>As for externals, suffice
it to say that they will be
<title>en suite</title>, and that I intend
to introduce just a little
touch of originality into my
trousers. I am going to
have them made with spats
sewn to the leg-ends in
order to save time and
trouble in dressing.</p>
        <p>In short, I have forgotten
nothing, except spare studs,
and I think it is quite likely that
I shall remember them too in course
of time. I have even gone so far as
to fix a day for a dress rehearsal.
But first I shall invite my friends,
as is the way with brides-elect, to a
private view of my trousseau, when
they shall see all of it spread upon the
coverlet of my bed, over the backs of
my chairs, or hanging in serried ranks
in my wardrobe.</p>
        <p>And now nothing more remains
to be done but to raise the necessary
funds, and with this object in view
I have instructed my broker to draw
my money out of the Savings Bank.
I am expecting a postal-order almost
any moment.</p>

          <lg>
            <l>I think not. Yet the rather stoutish man</l>
            <l rend="i2">Who never raised his head but chewed and chewed</l>
            <l>Annoyed me as I feasted. I began</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>I longed to point to him the hedges twined</l>
            <l rend="i2">With starry blossoms, and the coats like silk</l>
            <l>Of oxen as they wandered unconfined;</l>
            <l>I longed to ask him if his heavier mind</l>

        <head>AN UNPLAYED MASTERPIECE.</head>
        <p>[The growing popularity of the one-Act play
has prompted the aphorism that what is required
in this class of drama is a "maximum
of action with a minimum of explanation."
Nevertheless the following effort has been
rejected by every Manager in London—a fact
which decisively answers the oft-repeated
question, "Do Managers read plays?"]</p>
        <p>SCENE: A luxuriously furnished room
in the flat of <name>Violet Hazelwood</name>.
Violet is seated, writing. The telephone
on the table rings noisily.</p>
        <p><title>Violet</title> (picking up the receiver).
Hello! Yes.... It's me.... Oh,
it's Reggie.... Yes, I'm at home to
you.... In three minutes?... Right.
I shall be here.
(<title>Hangs up receiver.</title>)</p>
        <p><title>Maid</title> (entering suddenly). Sir Frank
Bulkeley, m'm.
(Goes out and Sir
Frank enters.)</p>
        <p><title>Sir Frank.</title> My dear Violet—— (A
report is heard and a splintering of
glass.) Confound it all, I'm shot!
(Falls on floor.)</p>
        <p><title>Violet.</title> Yes, he certainly appears to
be shot. I'd better go and see the
police about it.(Goes out.)</p>
        <p><title>Reggie Fortescue (entering precipitately</title>).
Violet.... (Looking round
in perplexity). Not here! She said
she would be here.... She is false
to me. False! I have nothing left to
live for.
(Takes out a revolver, shoots
himself and falls on the floor.)</p>
        <p><title>Gerald Maristowe (entering cautiously
through the window and carrying a rifle</title>).
This is a devil of a risky business, this
rifle practice, but Ulster must be saved
somehow. I see I've broken the window.
Wonder if I've done any other
damage. (<title>Sees</title> Sir Frank.) Gee! I've
killed a man! (<title>Sees</title> Reggie.) Oh, glory!
I've killed two of 'em! Reggie, too,
by all that's rum! I say, you know,
that's pretty useful shooting.... Still,
it probably means hanging, and I'm—er—hanged
if I'll be hanged. Let me
rather die by my own hand. (<title>Discharges
rifle at himself, and falls on floor.</title>)</p>
        <p><title>Violet</title> (<title>re-entering with an Inspector
and a Constable</title>). There he is, Inspector.
(<title>Sees</title> Gerald.) My goodness, there seem
to be two now! I feel sure.... (<title>Sees</title>
Reggie.) <title>Three!</title> Really, Inspector, I
feel almost certain that when I left....
Oh, it's Reggie! My heart is broken!
(<title>Faints.</title>)</p>
        <p><title>Inspector.</title> Stand back, Clarkson; this
job requires thought. (<title>Takes up telephone
receiver.</title>) Circus 20634, Miss....
That you Doc.? Come round at once,
please.... Two or three men shot....
Right.... (<title>Hangs up receiver.</title>)
Clarkson, measure the exact distance
between each corpse and the window.
(Clarkson <title>proceeds to do so</title>. <title>Enter</title>
Doctor.) Ah, Doc., that's the little job
I mentioned.</p>
        <p><title>Doctor</title> (<title>kneeling by</title> Violet). This one
isn't shot; she's only fainted. She'll
be all right in a minute. (<title>Examines</title>
Gerald.) Nor is this one. <title>He</title>'ll be all
right in a minute. (<title>Examines</title> Reggie.)
Nor is this one. <title>He'</title>ll be all right in
a minute. (<title>Examines</title> Sir Frank.) This
one is, though. Dead as a door-nail.
(Violet, Reggie <hi rend="it">and</hi> Gerald <title>rise simultaneously
to their feet</title>.) There you are!
I told you so.</p>
        <p><title>Gerald</title> (<hi rend="it">aside</hi>). Missed!</p>
        <p><title>Reggie</title> (<hi rend="it">aside</hi>). Missed! (<title>Aloud</title>)
Violet, I love you!</p>
        <p><title>Violet.</title> I'm <hi rend="it">so</hi> glad, because I love
you.</p>
        <p><title>Reggie</title> (<hi rend="it">confidentially</hi>). Do you know,
I really thought I was dead. Hello.
Gerald, old son, what are you doing
here?</p>
        <p><title>Gerald.</title> Oh, I thought I'd sort of
look in, you know.</p>
        <p><title>Inspector.</title> Violet Hazelwood, I arrest
you for the murder of Sir Frank
Bulkeley, Bart., and I warn you that
anything you may say will be used in
evidence against you. Clarkson, stop
playing with that tape and handcuff the
prisoner. (Clarkson <title>does so</title>.)</p>
        <p><title>Gerald</title> (<hi rend="it">aside</hi>). Good business! That
saves <hi rend="it">my</hi> neck.</p>
        <p><title>Violet.</title> But, my dear good soul....
However, I suppose it's no use to say
anything. Reggie, I can never marry
you now.</p>
        <p><title>Reggie.</title> You couldn't in any case, my
dear, because I haven't got any money.</p>
        <p><title>Violet.</title> You forget that you are sole
heir to Sir Frank there, who had fourteen
thousand a year. <title>I</title> thought of
that at once.</p>
        <p><title>Reggie.</title> Columbus! So I am. Well,
that <hi rend="it">is</hi> a dashed nuisance.</p>
        <p><title>Gerald</title> (<title>coming forward nobly</title>). My
dear, dear friends, I cannot allow your
happiness to be wrecked in this way.
I killed Sir Frank! You can be married
now.</p>
        <p><title>Reggie.</title> Good egg! (<title>Embraces</title> Violet.)</p>
        <p><title>Inspector.</title> Gerald Maristowe, I arrest
you for the murder of Sir Frank
Bulkeley, Bart., and I warn you that
anything you may say will be used in
evidence against you.</p>
        <p><title>Violet.</title> Oh, we must save him. What
can we do?</p>
        <p><title>Clarkson.</title> Lady, do you remember
years ago giving sixpence to a starving
boy in Peckham Rye?</p>
        <p><title>Violet.</title> Yes.</p>
        <p><title>Clarkson.</title><title>I</title> am—that is, <hi rend="it">was</hi>—that
boy. I will save your friend. Inspector,
you know that a reward of
£10,000 is offered for the capture of
the anarchist Mazzio?</p>
        <p><title>Inspector.</title> Yes. I wish to heaven
I could lay my hands on him.</p>
        <p><title>Clarkson.</title> I can tell you how to do so.</p>
        <p><title>Inspector.</title> How?</p>
        <p><title>Clarkson</title> (<title>dramatically tearing off his
wig and false moustache</title>). I am Mazzio!
(<title>Turning to</title> Gerald <title>and the others</title>) I
shall struggle violently. While he is
engaged in arresting me, you can make
good your escape.</p>
        <p><title>Inspector.</title> Ha! Do you think I can
be so easily baffled? (<title>Picking up telephone
receiver.</title>) There are other police
in the neighbourhood.</p>
        <p><title>Violet.</title> Not so. (<title>Slashes through the
telephone cord with a knife</title>).</p>
        <p><title>Gerald.</title> Bravo!</p>
        <p><title>Inspector.</title> Oh, well, never mind.
(Puts his head out of the window and
blows a police whistle. The others look
at one another in consternation.) Now
I think I am master of the situation.</p>
        <p><title>Clarkson.</title> Foiled! All the same, you
are less fortunate than you imagine.
When I said I was Mazzio, I lied.</p>
        <p><title>Inspector.</title> Prove it.</p>
        <p><title>Clarkson.</title> Easily. Mazzio has a scar
on his left forearm. (<title>Rolling up sleeve</title>)
I have none.</p>
        <p><title>Inspector.</title> Oh, well, never mind. I
can now proceed with the arrest of the
murderer of Sir Frank Bulkeley, Bart.</p>
        <p><title>Gerald</title> (<hi rend="it">aside</hi>). I'm done for!</p>
        <p><title>Clarkson.</title> There <hi rend="it">must</hi> be some way
of escape. Doc., it's up to you to do
something.</p>
        <p><title>Doctor.</title> With pleasure. I certify that
Sir Frank died from heart disease.</p>
        <p><title>Inspector</title> (<hi rend="it">stammering</hi>). But—but—but
he's <hi rend="it">obviously</hi> shot. I mean to
say——</p>
        <p><title>Doctor.</title> I certify that Sir Frank
Bulkeley died from heart disease ten
seconds before the bullet struck him
You can do nothing in the face of my
certificate.</p>
        <p><title>Gerald, Reggie and Violet.</title> Saved!</p>

        <p>"For instance, you've got it on the
tip of your tongue to ask me if I think
I'll lick Jimmy Battle next Thursday.
Well, of course I'll lick him. Jimmy's
a good boy, but he can't stay, and then
<hi rend="it">he</hi> hasn't gone twenty rounds with
three blacks, as I have. But what's
my opinion matter to you? Why
make me shout it out like a cock on
a steeple?</p>
        <p>"Yes, I shall beat Jimmy. Six
rounds will cure him. All right. Very
well then. Leave it at that.</p>
        <p>"One of your fellows called upon me
two days ago. 'Pete,' he said, 'they
say you're ill.' 'You tell 'em to mind
their own ills,' I gave him back. Ill,
indeed! If I were ill could I walk my
forty miles a day and think nothing of
it?" Could I lift Harry Blokes there
with one hand and hold him above my
head? D'you suppose a sick man
could do <hi rend="it">this</hi>?"</p>
        <p>The Puncher seized a skipping-rope
and did marvellous things with it.
Then he smashed lustily at a punch-ball,
left, right, left, right, duck, bing!
"Here, Harry!" he cried. His sparring
partner approached, bruised but
beaming. The Puncher knocked him
down.</p>
        <p>"I seem ill, don't I?" said Pete,
turning to me. "But what's it got to
do with all you chaps, anyway? Wait
till Thursday. Then you'll find out
whether I'm ill or not. And even if I
was ill Jimmy couldn't do it. Jimmy's
got as good a punch as the next man.
I'll say that for him. If he gets it in
it would foil an ox. But can he get it
in? Not next Thursday.</p>
        <p>"Now, see here, you're not going to
draw any words from me about the
coming fight. You may draw others.
I refuse. Let's get right off this fight
and on to other things.</p>
        <p>"After all, fighters are modest chaps.
When I knocked Torpedo Troop out
in three rounds last April for a purse
of £5,000 and the Championship of
Nova Scotia I didn't go bragging. I
might have said that this was the first
time that the Torpedo had ever had
his eyes closed. Well, I didn't. What's
more, I never shall. Tell your reader
that!</p>
        <p>"Take my victory over Quartermain,
again. Or over Dinghy Abbs, who was
down and out in the second round in
spite of all the fuss that was made about
him beforehand. I was a sick man at
both these fights. Not a soul knew it,
mind you. My wife—for I'm as fond
of home life as any ordinary man, and
we have a little baby—my wife used to
worry terribly. She'd expect me to
come home on a stretcher. But I
never happened to choose that conveyance,
and she don't fret any more.</p>
        <p>"Will it be a stretcher on Thursday?
I can see you want to put that question,
but I'll ask you to excuse me. Next
Thursday, as I've already hinted, will
tell its own story, and when I say that
the tale will have a happy ending for
one of us who isn't too far from your
ear to boast about it if he was inclined
that way, perhaps you'll guess without
my telling you what I mean.</p>
        <p>"Not at all, Sir. Don't mention it.
I'm always glad to have a friendly chat
with anyone, and I hope you'll forgive
me for refusing to talk shop."</p>

        <head>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</head>
        <p rend="center">(<hi rend="sc">Extracted from the Diary
of Toby, M.P.</hi>)</p>
        <p><title>House of Lords, Monday, July
13.</title>—<name rend="sc">Camperdown</name>, like <name rend="sc">Habakkuk</name>,
is <title>capable de tout</title>. Can do
(is at least ready to undertake)
anything. Like Lord <name rend="sc">John
Russell</name>, he would at an hour's
notice take charge of the British
fleet, whether in Home waters
or on Foreign stations. Confesses
with pathetic modesty
that there are two things beyond
his capacity. One is to find a
needle in a pottle of hay; the
other, to discover a teller in
Division Lobby when no one
proposes to tell.</p>

        <p>To-night this last dilemma
faced noble earl. Home Rule
Amendment Bill before House
in Report stage. <name rend="sc">Macdonell</name>
moved amendment introducing
principle of proportional representation.
After long debate
Question put from Woolsack. There
being a few cries of "Not content!"
House cleared for division.</p>
        <p>Hereupon strange thing happened.
Whilst majority of peers streamed into
Content Lobby discovery was made that
not only were there no tellers for the
Not-Contents but no Not-Contents for
the tellers. Fortunately <name rend="sc">Camperdown</name>
on the spot. Instantly took charge of
the affair. According to his own
narrative, which thrilled the
listening Senate, he had gone
into Division Lobby, "where,"
he added, "I stayed a long time."</p>
        <p>Began to realise something of
the feeling of the boy who stood
on the burning deck whence all
but he had fled. <name rend="sc">Camperdown</name>
essentially a man of action.
No use mooning round deserted
Lobby wondering where everybody
was.</p>
        <p>"I tried," he protested, "to
find a teller for the Not-Contents,
which I was not able to do.
There were no Not-Contents in
the Not-Contents' Lobby and
there were no tellers. I do not
know," he added, turning his
head with enquiring pose, like
<title>Mr. Pecksniff</title> asking his pupil
<title>Martin Chuzzlewit</title> to take compass,
pencil and paper, and "give
me your idea of a wooden leg,"
"whether any of your lordships
have seen an occurrence like
this before. I have not."</p>
        <p>Murmur of sympathy ran
round perturbed benches. Dilemma
awful, unprecedented,
irretrievable. But everyone felt that
<name rend="sc">Camperdown</name> had done his duty, and
that if he had failed to find Not-Contents
in an empty Lobby no one else
could have found them.</p>
        <p><title>Business done.</title>—In House of Commons
<name rend="sc">Premier</name> announced winding-up
of business at earliest possible moment
with intent to meet again in
"early winter" for new Session. No
Autumn Session, you'll observe.
Feeling against it so strong that
insistence might have broken
bonds that link faithful Ministerialists
with their esteemed
Leader. Accordingly prorogation
about usual time in
August, and new Session, instead
of opening in February,
will date from November. When
we come to think of it, seems
to amount to much the same
thing as Autumn Session, which
usually begins in mid-October.
That an illusion. There will be
no Autumn Session. Only we
shall all be back at Westminster
again in drear November.</p>

        <p><title>House of Commons, Tuesday.</title>—Like
<name rend="sc">Rachel</name> weeping for her
children, the Opposition will not
be comforted in respect of the
continued absence of <hi rend="sc">Chancellor</hi>
of the Duchy. 'Tis a touching
trait, illustrating the high
level of human nature the
Commons reach. Had it been
<name rend="sc">Masterman</name>'s political friends
who mourned his absence, recognising
in it cause of insecurity for the Empire,
situation would be natural and comprehensible.
It is from the so-labelled
enemy's camp that lamentation is
sounded. <name rend="sc">Worthington Evans, Masterman</name>'s
severest censor whilst he still
sat on Treasury Bench in charge of
Insurance Act, is in especial degree inconsolable.
Physically and intellectually
reduced to a pulp—using
the word of course in Parliamentary
sense.</p>
        <p>As he is too unnerved to
dwell upon subject, <name rend="sc">Barnston</name>
and <name rend="sc">Hayes Fisher</name> to-day take
it up. Want to know how long
a state of things most painful
on their side of the House is
to continue? <name rend="sc">Premier</name> makes
light reply. Points out that
it's no new thing for a Minister
to fail to find a seat, the globe
meanwhile serenely revolving
on its axis. In 1885 and in 1892
the Duchy was unrepresented on
the Treasury Bench.</p>
        <p>A more striking case, overlooked
by <name rend="sc">Premier</name>, of a Minister
long struggling with adversity
at the poll finding the
door of House of Commons
bolted and barred is familiar to
Lord <name rend="sc">Halsbury</name>. Appointed
Solicitor-General in 1875 <name rend="sc">Hardinge
Giffard</name> did not take his
seat till the Session of 1877.
Crushed at Cardiff, left in the
lurch at Launceston, hustled at
Horsham, named as a probable
starter at every election race<pb xml:id="Page_94" n="Pg 94"/>
in the three kingdoms taking place
within a period of eighteen months,
he persuaded the blushing borough of
Launceston, on a second wooing, to
yield to his advances.</p>
        <p>Oddly enough, when at last he came
to the Table to take the oath, he found
he had mislaid the return to the writ,
production of which is indispensable
preliminary. Was nearly turned back,
a calamity averted by discovery of the
document in his hat on a bench
under the Gallery where he had
awaited <hi rend="sc">Speaker</hi>'s summons to
the Table.</p>
        <p>But precedents are nothing when
the bosom is deeply stirred.</p>
        <p>"Can't the <hi rend="sc">Chancellor</hi> of the
Duchy make an effort to secure a
seat?" <name rend="sc">Barnston</name> asked in tremulous
voice.</p>
        <p>"He has made two already,"
retorted the practical <name rend="sc">Premier</name>.</p>
        <p>Then came along <name rend="sc">Watt</name>, with
cryptic inquiry breaking silence
that brooded over Ministerial
benches.</p>
        <p>"Has the time not arrived," he
asked, "to jettison <name rend="sc">Jonah</name>, in view
of the fact that nobody seems
willing to swallow him but the
whale?"</p>
        <p>House left thinking the matter
over.</p>
        <p><title>Business done.</title>—House of Lords
passed Third Reading of transformed
Home Rule Amendment
Bill. In the Commons Budget Bill
again dealt with in Committee.
Sharp strictures from both sides.
But Ministerialists who had come
to criticise remained to vote in its
favour. Majority accordingly maintained
at normal level.</p>
        <p><title>Wednesday.</title>—<name rend="sc">Son Austen</name>, who
little more than a fortnight ago left
the House Member for East Worcester,
returned to-day representing
the division of Birmingham where
his father sat impregnably throned
for uninterrupted period of twenty-nine
years. As he walked up to
Table to take the oath and sign afresh
the roll of Parliament, was hailed by
hearty burst of general cheering.</p>
        <p>This rare. Common enough for one
or other political party to welcome
recruit to its ranks. On such occasions,
the other side sit silent, save when
especial circumstances elicit responsive
bout of ironical cheering. To-day's
demonstration afforded striking recognition
of genuine merit modestly displayed.</p>
        <p>Ever a difficult thing for young
Member to be son of distinguished
father also seated in the House. Position
to be sustained only by exercise
of qualities of mind and manner
rarely combined. Whilst his father
yet enthralled attention and admiration
of House by supreme capacity
<name rend="sc">Son Austen</name> successfully faced the
ordeal. After <name rend="sc">Don José</name>'s withdrawal
from the scene his son's advance to a
leading place in the councils of his
party and the estimation of the House
was rapid. Within limits of present
Session he has shown increased power
as a debater, promising attainment of
still loftier heights. Ever courteous in
manner, untainted by the "new style"
deplored by <name rend="sc">Premier</name>, he, though an
uncompromising party man, has made
no personal enemies among any section
of his political opponents.</p>
        <p><title>Business done.</title>—House of Lords
threw out Plural Voters Bill on second
time of asking. Commons still in Committee
on Budget.</p>

        <head>EXERCISE 1.</head>
        <p>I must confess that at one time I
had little regard for collectors of
cigarette cards; it seemed a feeble
pursuit, though perhaps I should add
I am of a somewhat intellectual nature.

Some little time ago, however, I
happened to glance at one of these
cards and was surprised to see a picture
of a gentleman attired in white flannels
and a vest of white, decorated with red
embroidery. He was grasping a towel
in both hands and appeared to have
two or three sets of arms. The label
said, "Scarf or Towel Exercises 4." A
perusal of the instructions on the back
of the card made everything clear.</p>
        <p>Ten minutes later I entered the shop
of an athletic outfitter. Unfortunately
he had no white vests with red edges:
I had to purchase one with blue. A
scarf or towel I could find at home.</p>
        <p>Then I entered a tobacconist's.</p>
        <p>Four days later I had collected Scarf
or Towel Exercises 2 and 3.</p>
        <p>"We can," I said, "now make a
start." As a matter of fact it was not
altogether a foolish proceeding. Deep
thinkers are apt to overlook the need
for physical culture. This error I
decided to remedy.</p>
        <p>Every morning I (1) stood in position
illustrated, (2) raised arms above
head in manner indicated by the instructions,
(3) straightened right arm
and lowered right hand so that towel
(<title>still taut</title>) sloped to right, (4) returned
to Position 1. I then changed towel
for scarf (my own idea) and continued
with Exercises 3 and 4.</p>
        <p>I was very happy; my only worry
was the absence of Scarf or Towel
Exercises 1.</p>
        <p>Every morning I called at the
tobacconist's and purchased packets of
cigarettes, eagerly searching them for
the missing card. Every afternoon I
called again.</p>
        <p>For a week I bore my disappointment
bravely; then I became cynical.</p>
        <p>"Perhaps," I said, "there is no
Exercise 1. It may be a joke on the
part of the makers."</p>
        <p>My consumption of cigarettes increased.
Packet followed packet with
extraordinary rapidity, and still no
Exercise 1.</p>
        <p>I began to get worried. "Is it safe."
I asked myself, "to do 2, 3 and 4 without
1? The omission may have a
serious effect on 2, 3 and 4."</p>
        <p>Then I returned to the attack with
renewed vigour. In a week I got
through twenty tens—with no result.</p>
        <p>Disappointed and weary I was walking
to the office one morning when
suddenly I had an attack of giddiness.
By the end of the day I was beginning
to wonder if I was very ill. I felt it.
Usually the clearest of thinkers, I was
dizzy and dazed.</p>
        <p>The evening saw the arrival of my
doctor, and a thorough examination
followed, at the end of which he shook
his head gravely.</p>
        <p>"'M," he murmured. "Ah."</p>
        <p>"Tell me," I said with extraordinary
calmness—"tell me the worst. Brain
fever, I suppose?"</p>
        <p>"Oh, dear no," he replied. "What
I'm worrying about is the heart. It's
in a bad state-a really bad state.
Heaven knows how many cigarettes
you've been consuming lately. You'll
have to stop it altogether."</p>
        <p>I looked at him blankly; then, with
a bitter laugh, I (1) stood in position
illustrated, (2) raised arms above head
in manner indicated by the instructions,
(3) straightened right arm and
lowered right hand so that handkerchief
(<title>still taut</title>) sloped to right, and
(4) returned to sofa.</p>

motive, transplanting it from the polygamous
East into the England of one-man-one-wife.
His object, no doubt,
was to emphasize one aspect of his
borrowed theme, which is further enforced
by his choice of <hi rend="it">milieu</hi>—the
camp of the Puritans.</p>
        <p>Lest this fairly obvious note of
irony should escape us, Mr. <name rend="sc">Phillips</name>
accentuates it at the start by making
his <name rend="sc">David</name> (<title>Sir Hubert Lisle</title>, Commander
of the Parliamentary Forces in
the fenland) condemn a young officer
to be shot for a "carnal" offence. The
delinquent's answer—</p>
        <lg>
          <lg>
            <l>"Thou who so lightly dealest death to me</l>
            <l>Be thou then very sure of thine own soul;"</l>
          </lg>
        </lg>
        <p>and <title>Lisle's</title> prayer—</p>
        <lg>
          <lg>
            <l>"And judge me, Thou that sittest in Thy Heaven,</l>
            <l>As I have shown no mercy, show me none!...</l>
            <l>If ever a woman's beauty shall ensnare</l>
            <l>My soul into such sin as he hath sinned"—</l>
          </lg>
        </lg>
        <p>these passages, even if the title of the
play had not prepared us, afford fair
warning of the way in which things
have got to go. In fact it is all very
simple and straightforward, and (on
the constructive side) Hellenic. Perhaps
indeed the treatment is a little
too direct, and the tragedy moves too
quickly to its consummation (thirty or
forty minutes suffice for the reading of
it). It might serve its publisher (of the
Bodley Head) as one of a series to be
entitled: "Half-hours with the Best
Sinners."</p>
        <p>As a poem <title>The Sin of David</title> cannot
compare for beauty with <title>Paolo and
Francesca</title>, though it contains isolated
lines which recall Mr. <name rend="sc">Phillips</name>'s
earliest drama, such as the plea of
<title>Joyce</title>, the condemned officer—</p>
        <lg>
          <lg>
            <l>"Her face was close to me, and dimmed the world."</l>
          </lg>
        </lg>
        <p>or <title>Lisle's</title>—</p>
        <lg>
          <lg>
            <l>"Thou hast unlocked the loveliness of earth."</l>
          </lg>
        </lg>
        <p>But then, of course, the exotic manner
would here have been an impropriety.
This is not Rimini; it is the English
Fenland; and all the characters, with
the exception of <title>Miriam Mardyke</title> (the
<name rend="sc">Bathsheba</name> of the piece), who was bred
in France and had its sun in her blood,
were of the Puritan pattern that does
not accommodate itself very easily to
the language of passion.</p>
        <p>But all this we knew ten years ago,
when <title>The Sin of David</title> was first published;
and the only new interest was
the question of its adaptability to the
theatre. Poetic drama seldom gains
much by presentation on the stage,
unless it is full of action; and there is
little action in this play except of the
inward kind. In almost the only case
where quick movement is here demanded
one becomes conscious of the intrusion
of words. When he knows that the
relief of Pomfret depends upon his instant
action, <title>Lisle</title> still finds time for
conversations with his servant, with
<title>Miriam</title> and with the doctor, and for
a couple of well-sustained soliloquies.</p>
        <p>Certain lines, again, whose literary
flavour, when read, makes us overlook
their inherent improbability in the
mouth of the character that utters
them, take on, when spoken, an air of
artifice. Such are the lines in which
<title>Miriam</title> describes her old sister-in-law,
to her face, as</p>
        <lg>
          <l rend="i4">"living without sin</l>
          <l>And reputably rusting to the grave."</l>
        </lg>
        <p>And there is always the danger that
actors will be content with a rather
slurred and perfunctory recitation of
lines that have no bearing on the
action but are just inserted for joy as
a rhetorical embroidery.</p>
        <p>It may be a trivial criticism, but I
think the play suffered a little from the
appearance of the love-child whose
death was to be the punishment for
<title>Lisle's</title> sin in sending <title>Mardyke</title> to his
death in a forlorn hope. The instructions
in my book are contradictory.
The time of Act III. is described as
"five years later," and we are then told
that "four years are supposed to have
elapsed since Act II." Anyhow, the boy
should be only three or four years old.
Actually he is a girl (the stage must
have it so) of some ten summers. You
may say that all those years during
which the lovers' passion has been
purified by worship of the child's innocence,
and "God has not said a word,"
add a dramatic force to the blow when
at last it falls. But for myself—a mere
matter of taste—I feel that the vengeance
of Heaven has been nursed too
long.</p>
        <p>As for the interpretation, I must
honestly compliment Mr. <name rend="sc">Irving</name> and
Miss <name rend="sc">Miriam Lewes</name> on their performance.
It is true that I should never
have mistaken Mr. <name rend="sc">Irving</name> for a fighting
Roundhead, and he might well have
sacrificed something of his personality
for the sake of illusion. It is true, too,
that he was more concerned about
dramatic than poetic effects; yet, within
the limitations of a very marked individuality,
he did justice to the author by a
performance that was most sincere and
persuasive. Miss <name rend="sc">Lewis</name> played her
more difficult part with great charm
and delicacy. Her manner, even under
stress of passionate feeling, still kept the
right restraint that <title>Miriam</title> had learnt
from her environment; but always we
were made to feel that under the prim
Puritan gown was a body that had
been "born in the sun's lap," and held
the warmth of the vinelands in its veins.
Perhaps it was from France, too, that
<title>Miriam</title> had caught her strange habit
of pronouncing "my" (a perfectly good
word) as "me."</p>
        <p>There is little so worth seeing on the
stage to-day as <title>The Sin of David</title>, and
I very sincerely hope that both the
play and its interpreters may win the
wide appreciation they have earned.</p>

          <p>Lady Diana Dingo was in the Park
yesterday, walking with Lancelot, her
new ant-eater, and the latter, who
has happily recovered from his severe
attack of measles, is now quite tame,
and was wearing bronzed toe-nails and
a large blue ribbon under the left ear.</p>
          <p>The Countess of Torquay and her
sister, Mrs. Pygmalion Popinjay, were
at the Earl's Court Exhibition on
Wednesday. The Countess's crested
toucan, Willy, was much admired.</p>
          <p>The Ladies' Park Pet race at Ranelham
next Friday is expected to prove
an exciting event, especially as Stella.
Lady Killaloo, has entered her large
crocodile, Horace—called after her
late husband—who is known to prove
rather fractious at times.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Halliday Hare is in deep
mourning for her bandicoot, Maud
Eliza, who was unfortunately set upon
and eaten last week by the Hon. Mrs.
Joram's young jaguar during an afternoon
call at the house of a mutual
friend of their mistresses. Mrs. Hare
is leaving town at once, and her house
will be closed until late in the autumn.</p>
          <p>The iguana worn by Miss Bay Buskin
in the second Act of <title>The Belle of Bow
Street</title> is a delightful little creature, and
accompanies his mistress everywhere.
While on the subject of the theatre, we
are glad to learn that the cages now
being erected behind the stage at Galy's
Theatre will soon be ready, when there
should be no further cause for complaint
about the rapacity of some of
the larger carnivora owned by certain
ladies of the chorus.</p>
          <p>The recent fashion of having one's
pet emu coloured to match one's frock
is dying out, and armadilloes with
gilded trotters are becoming the vogue.</p>

          <p>"Very well," said the lady of the house, "don't let's do it.
Nobody can force us to go to the seaside if we don't want to."</p>
          <p>"It's too late," I said, "to begin to agree with me now."</p>
          <p>"It's never too late to realise how reasonable you are."</p>
          <p>"Yes, it is. The agreement is signed; half the rent has
been paid; Sandstone House has got us by the legs, and,
whether we like it or not, we've got to go there next week."</p>
          <p>"We might try the effect of a death-bed repentance."</p>
          <p>"No," I said, "we're dead already. We died when
the blessed agreement was signed."</p>
          <p>"Well, then, let's write and say our aunt from British
Columbia is about to arrive here unexpectedly on a visit to
us, and that sand and seaweed and prawns and star-fish are
simply death to her. We can wind up with a strong appeal
to the landlord's better nature. No true landlord can
wish to be responsible for the death of anybody's British
Columbian aunt."</p>
          <p>"You're quite wrong," I said. "Landlords just revel in
that kind of thing. Besides, he will not believe in our
aunt. He will say that she is too thin."</p>
          <p>"But the aunt I'm thinking of is stout and wheezy.
She is a widow; her name is Aunt Wilhelmina; except
ourselves there's nobody in the world left for her to cling
to. No marine landlord can dare to separate us from Aunt
Wilhelmina."</p>
          <p>"It's no good," I said. "I'll admit that your Aunt
Wilhelmina——"</p>
          <p>"She's only mine by marriage, you know; but I love
her like a daughter."</p>
          <p>"I admit," I continued, "that Aunt-by-marriage Wilhelmina
may some day be useful to us. We will put her by
for another occasion. But she can't help us now."</p>
          <p>"Well, go ahead yourself and suggest something, then."</p>
          <p>"I could suggest a thousand things. Suppose we just
pay the rest of the rent and don't go."</p>
          <p>"The man," she said with conviction, "is mad."</p>
          <p>"I thought you'd say that, and I know you'd say the
same about any other suggestion of mine, so I shan't make
any more."</p>
          <p>"You mustn't be sulky," she said.</p>
          <p>"I never am. I'm reasonable, but, as usual, you'll
realise it too late. Besides," I added, "it's you who've
brought us into this fix."</p>
          <p>"I?" she said with an air of wonder, "How can I
have done that?"</p>
          <p>"I'll tell you," I said firmly, for I saw that my chance
had come. "For weeks and weeks past you have been
engaged in shutting up avenues and closing loop-holes.
Wherever there was the tiniest way of escape from the
seaside, there you were with your walls and your fences,
until at last you'd got me safely penned in."</p>
          <p>"You didn't struggle much, did you?"</p>
          <p>"No, I was like the man in <title>The Pit and the Pendulum</title>,
and you were—whoever it was that made the walls close
in on him."</p>
          <p>"I refuse," she said, "to be called a Spanish Inquisition."</p>
          <p>"You may refuse as much as you like, but that's the
sort of thing you've been. How you worked on my
domestic affections and my household pride! When Helen
forgot to go to her music-lesson you said the poor child
was evidently run down and wanted a breath of sea-air.
When Rosie lost her German exercise-book, and when
Peggy fell off her bicycle, you worked both these accidents
round into an imperative demand for salt water. When
John was bitten by a gnat you said the spot was bilious
and things would never be right with him until he got into
a more bracing climate; and when Bates tripped up in the
pantry and broke a week's income in plates and dishes you
said he needed tone and would get it at the sea. Seaside,
seaside, seaside! I couldn't got away from it."</p>
          <p>"Oh, but you haven't been there yet, you know. You're
shouting before you're hurt."</p>
          <p>"No," I said, "I am not—I mean I am hurt, but I'm
not shouting. I'm just whispering a few salutary truths."</p>
          <p>"And there's another thing," she said; "it must be terrible
for you to know what a designing person your wife is."</p>
          <p>"Madam," I said, "my wife is as heaven made her. I
will not permit her to be abused. She has good impulses.
She means well. Her plain sewing is quite excellent."</p>
          <p>"Spare me," who said, "oh spare me. I will never go to
the sea again."</p>
          <p>"But you <hi rend="it">shall</hi> go to the sea," I said. "Everything is
settled. The agreement is signed; the tickets are all but
taken. John and Peggy are panting for pails and spades.
Do you think I want to stand in the way of their innocent
pleasures? We will all try for shrimps while you sit on a
heap of sand and tell us not to get too wet, or that it's
time for tea, and have I forgotten the thermos-flask again."</p>
          <p>"Horatio," she said, "I can see you paddling in my
mind's eye."</p>
          <p>"But tell me," I said, "when do we start."</p>
          <p>"We start on Tuesday. The whole lot of us together,
you know, servants and all. Won't that be fun?"</p>
          <p>"Ye—es," I said, "it will—I mean it would if I could
go with you, but unfortunately——"</p>
          <p>"<title>What!</title>" she said, "you mean to desert us?"</p>
          <p>"No, no, I can never desert you, but I've got two
solemn engagements on Tuesday—meetings in the City."</p>
          <p>"Then I'm to take the whole party, am I?"</p>
          <p>"Yes, dear," I said. "And I'll join you next day."</p>
          <p>"You've won," she said.</p>

          <p rend="center">(<title>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</title>)</p>
          <p>If memory serves me, the publishers of <title>World's End</title>
(<name rend="sc">Hurst and Blackett</name>) described its theme as one of
unusual delicacy, or words to that effect. I should like to
reassure them. The particular kind of marriage of convenience
which it concerns (marriage for the convenience of
the wronged heroine, by which the virtuous hero gives his
name to the child of the villain) may be, indeed is, a delicate
matter, but—in fiction at least—by no manner of means
unusual. Nor can I see that its present treatment by
<name rend="sc">Amèlie Rives</name> (Princess <name rend="sc">Troubetzkoy</name>) lends it any degree
of novelty. No, let me be just; perhaps <title>Richard Bryce</title>, the
wicked betrayer, does strike a somewhat new note, at least
in his beginnings. <title>Richard</title> was the product of art superimposed
upon dollars. He was so cultured that the
humanity in him had dwindled to a negligible quantity;
and thus, when poor <title>Phoebe</title> wanted him to "do the right
thing by her," he sent her instead some charmingly modern
French verse—which she could not understand—and finally
took ship for Europe in mingled alarm and boredom. You
will have gathered that the scene is laid in America.
Perhaps this explains the hero. <title>Owen Randolph</title> was one
of the strong and silent. He was so silent that, though he
knew perfectly well all that had happened, he married
<title>Phoebe</title>, and allowed that unhappy lady to suffer chapters
of agonized apprehension as to his attitude, when half-a-dozen
words would have set her at ease on the subject.
He was, moreover, so strong that, when eventually the
theme of their relations with <title>Phoebe</title> did crop up between
himself and <title>Richard</title>, the latter spent some months in
hospital as a consequence. However, he recovered, and
things were thus able to reach the kind of ending which
was expected of them. There are parts of <title>World's End</title>
that are worthy of a better whole, but that is the best I can
say for it.</p>
          <milestone rend="hr" unit="rule"/>
          <p>I believe that <title>Paul Moorhouse</title> (<name rend="sc">Long</name>) was never really
predestined to end unhappily and that his suicide was a
conclusion as little premeditated by the author as it was
apparently by the hero. If such ends must be, they should
be a climax demanded by relentless logic: some sort of
culminating event should occur which, added to what has
gone before, leaves no alternative. <title>Paul</title>, however, had
survived for years under the stress of all the circumstances
which finally constrained him to make an end of himself;
and, had he stayed the course—only another hour or so—he
would have found that all had turned out for the best and
that adequate arrangements had been made for his permanent
happiness. No doubt these things happen in real life
and I cannot accuse Mr. <name rend="sc">George Wouil</name> (a most
discerning
author) of any inhuman treatment of his puppet; yet I
wish that he had been more kindly disposed and had spared
me a bitter disappointment. Having known <title>Paul</title>, man
and boy, for upwards of ten years, I had become sincerely
attached to him; as assistant time-keeper, foreman and
works-manager he showed a spirit true to the real Black
Country type. He had his moments of weakness when he
went astray after the manner of his kind; but he always
became master of himself again and, when he had to, paid
like a man the price of his misdeeds, never pausing to discover<pb xml:id="Page_100" n="Pg 100"/>
the overcharge. As for <title>Joan Ware</title>, his intended and
his due, she was a dear; poor dear!</p>

          <p>I do not think that you will believe <title>The Story of Fifine</title>
(<name rend="sc">Constable</name>), although Mr. <name rend="sc">Bernard Capes</name> takes some
pains to give it an air of actuality; but if you are like me
you will not be greatly concerned about that. Purporting
to be the ill-used daughter of a mad French marquis,
<title>Fifine</title>, in that <title>naïve</title> and charming way which has always
been so dear to the hearts of novelists, came to live at the
bachelor abode in Paris of the sculptor <title>Felix Dane</title> (his half-sister,
who was keeping house for the marquis, provided
the introduction), and, calling each other "cousin" and
"gossip," these two shared rooms together in perfect simplicity
of soul and held several conversations which reflect.
I suppose, Mr. <name rend="sc">Bernard Capes'</name> views on the plastic arts
and life in general. And why, in passing, he should continue
to heap ridicule on staid Victorian respectability I
cannot for the life of me imagine. The plucky and unorthodox
thing nowadays
surely is to make game
of Bohemianism. But,
anyhow, the happy moment
for me arrived when
<title>Felix Dane</title> suggested (on
the grounds that the
marquis would soon discover
his daughter's hiding-place)
a holiday tour
through Provence. Mr.
<name rend="sc">Bernard Capes</name> in Provence
is Mr. <name rend="sc">Bernard
Capes</name> at his best. How
the lovers (for that—perhaps
you roguishly
guessed it?—they gradually
became) paid visits
to Nîmes, to Aigues-Mortes,
to Arles and to
Paradou les Baux, and
met <title>M. Carabas Cabarus</title>,
the native minstrel, you
must read for yourself,
for I cannot give a faint
idea of the eloquence with
which their fairyland is portrayed. And if the plot ends as
artificially as it began, and with an unnecessary tragedy
thrown in, I suppose for the sake of that idyll in the very
nesting-place of idylls I must shrug my shoulders and forgive.
After all, it does not matter much who <title>Fifine</title> really
was, nor what happened to her. Suffice it that Mr. <name rend="sc">Bernard
Capes</name> has conducted her to Arles.</p>
          <milestone rend="hr" unit="rule"/>
          <p><title>The Caddis-Worm</title> (<name rend="sc">Hurst and Blackett</name>) is an appropriate
enough title for Mrs. <name rend="sc">Dawson Scott</name>'s novel, but I
confess to having grown a little restive at its appearance
on the top of each of 352 pages. "Episodes in the Life of
Richard and Catharine Blake" is the alternative title, and
to the average human reader possibly a more significant
one. <title>The Caddis-Worm</title> is quite in the modern manner,
having no plot—or what has been contemptuously called
"anecdote." I have, however, a more genuine grievance
against Mrs. <name rend="sc">Dawson Scott</name>, and it is that she seems
inclined to be a propagandist without the requisite robustness.
A little more vigour in her protests against the
iniquity of British laws, and her theme might have allured
me. As it is, the troubles of <title>Catharine</title> with her peremptory
<title>Richard</title> only made me want, but not very keenly, to
take and give her a good shaking. Whereas, with a little
more encouragement, I believe I should have been quite
anxious to kick her husband from the top to the bottom of
several flights of stairs. Drastic methods were taken by
the author to bring <title>Richard</title> to his senses; in fact, at one
time he made a sort of corner in disasters. But unless a
sanatorium exists where patients are treated kindly and
firmly for swollen-head I do not think that <title>Richard's</title> cure
is likely to be permanent. That, however, does not affect
my view that Mrs. <name rend="sc">Dawson Scott</name> has given us a book
which is full of clever writing and fairly shrewd observation.</p>

          <p>"It was a wild wet night, though the month of May was
well begun." Without caring very much about the month
of May, I felt on reading these introductory words that the
story called <title>My Lady Rosia</title> had excellently well begun. I
am sorry to add, though, that it does not carry on quite so
bravely as you might expect from such a start. My own
suspicion is that <title>Lady Rosia</title> is one of many novels that
owe their existence to a summer holiday. I haven't the
slightest knowledge of
the facts, and still less
wish to incur a libel
action, but, by my way
of imagining it, Miss
<name rend="sc">Freda Mary Groves</name>
found herself one day in
the Winchelsea country,
fell very naturally in love
with its jolly old houses,
and determined there and
then to write a story
about them. So here it
is, with a mildly romantic
hero, <title>Bernard</title>, a heroine
in the title <title>rôle</title> who
is as pretty and persecuted
as heroines should
be, a villain (<title>Lord Segrave</title>
by name—even, you see,
in those Black-Princely
days peers were a bad
lot), some conflicts not
quite so exciting as they
might have been, and
the rest of the mixture
as before. You perhaps catch already my chief ground of
complaint. Frankly I do not think that Miss <name rend="sc">Groves'</name> pen
is quite sufficiently dashing for this sort of thing. Historical
and adventurous romance, if it is to earn my vote, must keep
me out of breath the whole time. It should never be allowed
to slacken pace; and (to be entirely candid) <title>My Lady Rosia</title>
sometimes ambles rather heavily. I forgot to add that it is
published by <name rend="sc">Washbourne</name>, printed on detestable paper,
and contains some pleasant illustrations of the places mentioned
in the story. In few, the best I can say of it is that it
would make a charming gift for the young Person (if she still
survives) on the occasion, say, of a family holiday to Hastings.</p>
