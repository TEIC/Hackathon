Scripts, data and results for TEI Hackathon

Digital humanists, librarians, publishers, and many others use the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines to mark up electronic texts, and over time have created a critical mass of XML â€” some conforming to known subsets of the TEI Guidelines, some to individual customizations; in some cases intricate and dense, in others lean and expedient; some enriched with extensive external metadata, others with details marked explicitly in the text. The fruits of this labor are most often destined for display online or on paper (!), indexing, and more rarely, visualisation. Techniques of processing this markup beyond display and indexing are less well-understood and not accessible to the broad community of users, however, and programmers sometimes regard TEI XML as over-complex and hard to process.

The goal of the hackathon is to make significant progress on a few projects during one day of work (from 9am to roughly 5.30pm).
Possible projects might include but are not limited to:
 * applying visualisation to TEI documents or schemas/ODDs (e.g. visualizing the TEI conceptual model)
 * mining a large corpus of texts for some data facet and visualising the results
 * rendering complex markup in an innovative and playful way
 * writing input or output filters for existing bits of software
 * extending existing TEI software to take advantage of external resources such as Zotero
 * adding a TEI mode to a web editor
 * Programming for multilingual resources
